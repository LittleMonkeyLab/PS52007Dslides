# PS52007D Research Methods in Psychology - Slides 

## Academic Year 2022-23

This is the first year I am trying to deliver Open First teaching materials. "If a job's worth doing, it's worth over-doing!" as they say. 
I welcome feedback and tips/suggestions on how to improve.
Key priorities: 
- Accessibility
- Engagement via content and by use of technology
- Inclusivity
- Playfulness
