# Overview of today's lab activities

# Ethics II & Reliability and Validity

This week has two major areas of focus - a deeper dive on the Ethics
Application Portal, including information that will be required, and to
recap Psychometric Reliability and Validity.

## By the end of the session, you will have:

This week is focussed on the following overarching learning objectives

::: callout
-   Be fully prepared to submit a successful Ethics Application
-   Understand and be able to critically assess the strengths and
    limitations of psychological measures in terms of their reliability
    and validity.

## Two main parts of the lab this week

## Activities for this week

-   [ ] Ethics Portal information deep dive
-   [ ] Psychometric Reliability and Validity

## Ethics II

Familiarise yourself with the important Ethics resources available on
the VLE. These include general Research guidelines, but some specific to
online research too (should you plan to work online only).

Successfully logging in to the Goldsmiths Research Ethics portal and
reviewing all the information you will be required to submit in support
of your ethics application. By being aware of this, you can offset any
problems.

::: callout-warning
## Please pay close attention to detail

Any errors will result in an application being returned and a
resubmission will be required.
:::

## Please see the worksheet on the VLE for detailed guidance

## Reliability and Validity

The Worksheet this week has a comprehensive overview of 4 Validities and
4 Reliabilities, as well as ways to accentuate the quality of research
tools.

This material is designed to poiint you towards more focussed
assessments of research tools than you may have been considering up to
this point.

It is not usually good enough to say "this tool lacks validity" - you
need to go much deeper and argue your assessment.
