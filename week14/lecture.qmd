## Clinical Pathway - 20,000 Psych Graduates/year

![](images/Clinical%20Pathway.png)

## Known Challenges

-   Limited opportunity to gain 'on the job' experience

-   **Highly** competitive and uncertain

-   The vast majority of **Psych** careers require an MSc. Like another
    3rd year (Â±5 modules (inc. RM and a dissertation). Usually 2 days
    per week FT.

## Embracing Innovative Research Methods

-   **Explore Qualitative Research**: Engage deeply with qualitative
    research methods. Develop skills in ethnography, narrative analysis,
    and discourse analysis to bring fresh perspectives to clinical
    psychology.

-   **Methodological Innovation**: Foster a creative approach to
    research methods. Break away from conventional techniques and
    develop novel research strategies that address complex psychological
    issues.

-   **Utilize Theoretical Frameworks**: Integrate diverse theoretical
    perspectives such as feminism, poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,
    and Marxism into your research. This interdisciplinary approach can
    enrich your understanding and application of clinical psychology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Developing a Unique Professional Identity

-   **Political and Ethical Awareness**: Cultivate an awareness of the
    moral and political dimensions of psychology. Understand how your
    work can contribute to societal change and uphold ethical standards
    in research.

-   **Reflexivity and Critical Thinking**: Practice reflexivity in your
    work. Be critical of your biases and assumptions, and understand how
    they influence your research and clinical practice.

-   **Advocacy and Empowerment**: Position yourself as an advocate for
    marginalized communities. Use your skills to empower individuals and
    groups, contributing to social justice through clinical psychology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Crafting a Standout Identity and Personal Statement

-   **Professional Presence**: Join Linkedin, attend seminars or
    conferences, advertise your research skills/interest, join volunteer
    organisations

-   **Tailored CVs**: Customize your CV for each application. Highlight
    relevant coursework, projects, and research experiences that align
    with clinical psychology.

-   **Impactful Personal Statements**: Convey your passion for
    psychology and your commitment to pursuing a career in clinical
    psychology. Reflect on experiences that shaped your interest and how
    they prepare you for this field.

-   **Showcase Skills and Achievements**: Clearly articulate your
    skills, especially in research methods, critical thinking, and
    communication. Include any awards, presentations, or publications to
    demonstrate your competence and dedication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## References

-   References can be a powerful addition to any application, or a
    weakness

-   References should align with the content of your application

-   A referee needs to be able to speak to Academic ability,
    Professional Skills, Team Work, Extra-Curricular/Voluntary work

# You can be working on all of these things NOW!

## Summer in Second Year

-   GRIP and Departmental Bursaries

-   Opportunities to do voluntary work

-   Other options

## Here's what they don't tell you and maybe you don't want to hear

-   The next step on any **Psych** career is a Masters.

-   Therefore, getting on the right programme is the key.

-   It's about Academic merit and the little extras.

-   The best applicants I interview have a 'Research Narrative'
    (Relevant Y3 Dissertation and Proposed MSc Dissertation).

-   And enough 'experience' to illustrate effort and engagement with the
    field.

## Final words on the **Psych** careers

-   Don't think of it as a 'different' domain to where you are now.

-   Experience can be in the lab, or on a research project with vague
    relevance!

-   Samaritans, CirclesUk, any of the virtual helplines etc. All very
    flexible to your time

## Alternative Careers (with HR Hiring rounds)

-   Put effort into the application process and **prepare** for the
    interviews carefully.

-   Illustrate your skills (with examples) and break down all the things
    you have learned here.

-   Try to get a reference that highlights the same skills you are
    mentioning.

## Marketable Skills of a Psychology Graduate

-   **DATA-SKILLS**: Ability to analyze and interpret data, identifying
    patterns and drawing logical conclusions from **DATA**.
-   **Research Skills**: Proficiency in designing, conducting, and
    analyzing research, including both quantitative and qualitative
    methods.
-   **Communication**: Strong verbal and written skills for effectively
    conveying complex psychological concepts to diverse audiences.
-   **Empathy and Interpersonal Skills**: Exceptional understanding of
    human behavior and the capacity to empathize with clients from
    varied needs etc.
-   **Problem-Solving Abilities**: Aptitude for identifying problems,
    generating solutions, and implementing effective strategies in
    **Project Management**.
-   **Ethical and Cultural Awareness**: Deep understanding of ethical
    considerations in psychology and sensitivity to cultural
    differences.

## Alternative Careers (without HR Hiring rounds)

-   If there is a human involved, then your Psych background is
    valuable. Make it count!

-   Network and sell your idea/perspective/skills

-   Build a portfolio or a profile

-   Knock on doors and try to understand the industry

-   Science the sh\*t out of it!

## Last words

-   Don't be in a hurry

-   If you are in a hurry, be strategic and devious

-   Try to understand yourself (as much as you can)

-   Talk to as many people as you can!
