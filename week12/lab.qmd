## 2. Ethics Applications URGENT

-   **Importance**: Ethical approval is crucial to allow for data
    collection/submission of the Mini-Dissertation.
-   **Steps**:
    -   If approval is pending, please submit TODAY.
    -   If you face obstacles, please engage your Lab Tutor/Gordon
        IMMEDIATELY.
    -   We have been asked to close applications.
-   **Reminder**: Not submitting ethics can potentially mean you need to
    repeat the year.

## 3. Begin Writing Method Section

-   **Importance**:
    -   If you have Ethical Approval, your method is fixed.
    -   You can win a great deal of marks with the method section, and
        so give it time!
-   **Tips**:
    -   Be precise and detailed to allow for replication.
    -   Use the extensive suite of resources on the VLE and the
        internet!
-   **Objective**: Alongside your Open Materials - a one stop toolkit to
    replicate your study in perfect detail.
