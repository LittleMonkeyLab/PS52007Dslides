## Activities for this week

-   [ ] Ethics 'over-the-shoulder' in labs.

## Ethics II

Familiarise yourself with the important Ethics resources available on the VLE. These include general Research guidelines, but some specific to online research too (should you plan to work online only).

Successfully logging in to the Goldsmiths Research Ethics portal and reviewing all the information you will be required to submit in support of your ethics application. By being aware of this, you can offset any problems.

::: callout-warning
## Please pay close attention to detail

Any errors will result in an application being returned and a resubmission will be required.
