## This week

-   Social Psychology submission due
-   2 parts to the lab
    -   Ethics II - the Goldsmiths Portal
    -   Reliability and Validity recap materials

# Any Questions?

## Key topics today

# How do we measure or assess psychological concepts and constructs?

## Psychometrics; the science of psychological assessment.

General reader: Breakwell, Smith & Wright (2012) -- Chapter 7 (available
via reading list free online)

## What Myers-Briggs type are you?

![](images/paste-A2717D53.png)

## Myers-Briggs...

-- Based on Jung's non-scientific ideas about personality

-- The four dimensions are binary. But most characteristics are normally
distributed

-- Very poor test-retest reliability.

-- Almost no research support.

-- Company behind the test CPP makes \$20 million a year from it. Has
little incentive to start from scratch!

## What is psychometrics?

-- Meaning from Greek origin: 'measuring the soul'

-- Psychometrics is the field of study concerned with the theory and
technique of psychological measurement, which includes the measurement
of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits

-- Refers to all areas of psychology concerned with psychological
measurement (methods of testing and substantive findings)

-- Two major research tasks:

-- (i) the construction of instruments and procedures for measurement;

-- (ii) the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to
measurement

## A brief history of psychometrics

-- Charles Darwin's (1809--1882) Origin of the Species impacts
scientific thinking in 19 th century

-- Evolution (anthropology) combined with quantification (allure of
numbers)

-- Francis Galton (1822--1911) builds on cousin Darwin's ideas with
measurement and statistics

## A brief history of psychometrics

-- Galton developed the theory underpinning correlation and regression

-- Used this theory to try to explain the heritability of human ability
and achievement (amongst many other things)

-- Developed a lab and tests for many concepts e.g. prayer, boredom,
beauty

## What is a psychometric test?

-   Sample of affect, behaviour, cognition etc

-   Obtained under standardized conditions

-   Scored using rules that provide allow for comparison of individuals

-   Ideally, we would like:

    -   Multiple samples

    -   Multiple situations (contexts, several occasions)

    -   Multiple methods

## But you can't always get what you want...

Often, must measure individuals on

-   One occasion
-   Timed/ restricted conditions

So must use efficient methods

-   Many opportunities (multiple choice tests)
-   Objective scoring (no judgment involved)
-   Adaptive item selection

## Differences between a psychometric test and a general survey

-   Scientific rationale
-   Careful item development and test construction
-   Objective
-   Standardised
-   Instructions
-   Scoring procedure
-   Reliable
-   Valid

## Clinical uses of psychometric tests

-   Describe current functioning
-   Further investigate impressions from less formal evaluation
    approaches
-   Identify therapeutic needs
-   Aid in differential diagnosis of disorder
-   Monitor treatment over time to monitor success and identify new
    treatment needs
-   Provide empathetic feedback

## Occupational uses of psychometric tests

-   Initial hiring
-   Job selection
-   Team development
-   Career counseling
-   Training readiness
-   Succession planning
-   Performance assessment
-   Promotion

## Educational uses of psychometric tests

-   Counseling
-   School exams
-   University entrance exams
-   Course exams
-   Learning disabilities

## Types of psychometric tests

Maximum performance test (can do)

-   Intelligence tests (basic reasoning ability common to a variety of
    intellectual tasks)
-   Attainment tests (mastery tests, e.g., your exams, certification
    testing)

Typical performance test (will do)

-   Personality tests (ways of thinking, feeling and behaving)
-   Careers and interests tests

-- Different answer demands: effort versus candid truth

-- Context dependent

## Examples of maximum performance items (ability)

Odd one out

`Tree, Man, Paper, Mouse`

Next in sequence

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8â€¦`

## Spatial reasoning

First 3 form a series,

Which comes next A, B or C ?

## Stimulus

## Image rotation task

## Examples of typical performance items

Rate on a scale from 1 to 5 how true this is of you

(Costa & McCrae, 1992, Big Five)

`Once I find the right way to do something, I stick to it`

Dichotomous yes/ no answers

(Eysenck & Eysenck, 1976, Giant 3):

`I am the life of a party`

Forced choice

(Zuckerman, 1979, Sensation Seeking Scale)

`A: I like "wild" uninhibited parties`

`B: I prefer quiet parties with good conversation`

## Properties of Psychometric tests

Properties of psychometric tests

Two important properties of psychometric tests

[Reliability]{.underline}

--The consistency with which a test measures the construct

[Validity]{.underline}

--The degree to which a test actually measures what it claims to measure
"accuracy"

## Essential properties: Validity

A test is valid if it assesses what it claims to measure

The validity of an assessment strategy is the extent to which the
strategy yields a reasonably accurate estimation of the characteristic
or phenomenon in question.

Many steps to achieve validity (including concurrent validity,
predictive validity, construct validity and face validity)

## Essential properties: Reliability

Test retest reliability

-- Rule of thumb r between the two test times , 3 months apart \> 0.7
(just under 50% agreement)

-- Test re-test reliability is not perfect -- never reaches 1: beware
real changes!

Internal consistency reliability

-- Internal consistency is the degree to which all items are measuring
the same construct

-- Cronbach's Alpha should be greater than .70 for scales with items \>
10

## Reliability and Validity

I like to think of them as Consistency and Accuracy

## Different types of tests - raters

Behavioral observation (observer-rated)

-- People scored according to behaviors observed by a rater

-- Used frequently in work and clinical settings (e.g. Performance
appraisal)

Self-report

-- Subjects indicate their level of agreement or preference concerning
statements reflecting attitudes or behaviors

-- Response distortion is a problem (e.g. faking a personality test)

## Standardizing psychometric test scores

The raw score on many psychometric tests is based on an arbitrary scale

To give the scores meaning, we compare a person's scores to a meaningful
comparison group

Statistical basis: Normal distribution

Most human traits approximate to normal curve

--Largest number of cases cluster in centre

--Area under curve can be closely specified from mean and standard

## Next week...

We might go about developing our own Psychometric Test.. if you want.
