## Introduction

- Welcome to Week 8!  
- Today’s topic is one that I’m sure you’re deeply excited about: **Ethics**.  
- Objectives:
  - Recap the requirements for this year’s ethics mini-dissertation.
  - Understand how this relates to your projects.

---

## Ethics Application Overview

- This year, you are required to produce **Category A applications only**.  
  - **Category A**: Ethics applications with no significant ethical considerations.  
  - Entry-level quality, with minimal complexity.  
- Comprehensive materials are available on the **ETHICS VLE page**, signposted from the VLE module page.

---

## Ethics Resources

- Use the **QSF template file**:
  - Available on the Research Methods Ethics Resources page.  
  - Must be imported into a Quarto project (cannot be opened natively).  
- Key contents:
  - Ethics-relevant guidance.
  - Consent form templates.
  - GDPR-compliant Qualtrics survey templates.

---

## Consent Form and GDPR Compliance

- Consent forms must:
  - Be clear and concise (avoid excessive length).
  - Adhere to GDPR requirements.  
- Surveys must:
  - Reject participants who do not give **full informed consent**.  This requires **SKIP LOGIC**
- Common issues leading to rejections:
  - Inadequate or incomplete consent forms.
  - Failure to meet GDPR standards.

---

## Submission Requirements

- Complete the form in the **Ethics Portal** clearly and carefully:
  - Answer all questions, even if some seem irrelevant.  
  - Avoid collecting surplus data; focus on what is necessary to answer your research question.  

---

## Submission and Turnaround Times

- Turnaround time:
  - **One week** for feedback (not necessarily approval).  
  - Resubmissions add additional weeks.
- Ethics portal is open until **Week 11**.  
- Aim to submit early to avoid delays.
- Your Lab Tutors will approve prior to it being sent to the committee. You can do this in the lab.

---

## Personal Tutorials

- Discuss your ethics application during this week’s tutorial:  
  - Get feedback from your personal tutor.  
  - Ensure your application is thorough and accurate.  

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Deception or Hidden Information**:  
   - Be transparent in your informed consent and debrief.  
   - Deceptive practices require explicit justification and careful debriefing.

2. **Incomplete Applications**:
   - Include all group members in the application.  
   - Missing members = risk of failure for that individual.  

3. **Inadequate References**:
   - Provide accessible references for your audience.  
   - Avoid overly complex citations.

---

## Final Reminders

- Prioritize your ethics application; don’t leave it until the last minute.  
- Conduct independent study to ensure your application is approved.  
- Remember: ethics approval is a critical step for your research project!
