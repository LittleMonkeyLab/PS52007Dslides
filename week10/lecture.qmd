# Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Enhance transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.
-   **Focus Areas**:
    -   Open Data
    -   Open Materials
    -   Reflective Account

# Why Open Science Matters

-   Ensures research credibility and integrity.
-   Facilitates peer review and replication.
-   Increases research visibility and impact.
-   Encourages innovation and collaborative opportunities.

# Open Data Requirements

## What is Open Data?

-   **Definition**: Making research data accessible for transparency and reproducibility.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Promotes collaboration.
    -   Advances scientific knowledge.
    -   Increases study credibility.

## Preparing Your Data

-   Clean, validate, and anonymize your data.
-   Remove errors, inconsistencies, or missing values.
-   Anonymize participant data: Replace PII with unique identifiers.

## Data Dictionary

-   Document the dataset structure for easy understanding:
    -   Variable names and descriptions
    -   Data types (categorical, continuous)
    -   Units of measurement (e.g., ms, hours)
    -   Coding schemes (if applicable)

## Documenting Pre-processing

-   Describe decisions on exclusions, missing data handling.
-   Keep a record of processing steps for transparency.

## Choosing Suitable Formats

-   CSV, Excel (.xlsx), SPSS (.sav), Jamovi, R.
-   Ensure formats are user-friendly and well-documented.

## Where to Avoid SPSS Dumps

-   **Important**: Do not submit the full SPSS output.
-   **What to Include**:
    -   Key statistics and results in your report.
    -   Relevant outputs only for transparency.

# Open Materials Requirements

## Why Submit Open Materials?

-   Enables replication and evaluation of research.
-   Ensures all materials are well-organized and complete.

## Key Materials to Include

-   Stimuli (images, videos, text)
-   Experimental software/scripts
-   Data collection tools (surveys, questionnaires)
-   Consent, debriefing, and ethics forms
-   Study protocols and task instructions

## Documenting Your Materials

-   Provide a description of each itemâ€™s purpose.
-   Indicate whether materials are IVs or DVs.
-   Include labels, reverse-coded items, and response scales.

## Study Design

-   Study types: Repeated Measures, Mixed, Between-Groups.
-   Participants: Demographics, recruitment, sample size, inclusion/exclusion criteria.
-   Procedures: Task instructions, randomization, counterbalancing.

## Anonymizing and Sharing

-   Ensure PII is removed.
-   Redact researcher names if anonymity is required.
-   Prepare files in text, spreadsheet, or PDF formats.

## Submission Organization

-   Consider a README file for clarity.
-   Index documents logically for easy navigation.

# Reflective Account Requirements

## Why Reflect?

-   Develop deeper learning and research skills.
-   Prepare for future research projects and careers.

## Reflection Guide 1/2

-   **Document Your Journey**:
    -   Research phases, successes, and challenges.
    -   Record decisions and learning experiences.
-   **Ask Critical Questions**:
    -   What worked well? What could improve?
    -   How did challenges affect your outcomes?
    
## Reflection Guide 2/2

-   **Evaluate & Synthesize**:
    -   Identify strengths and areas for improvement.
    -   Set future research goals.
-   **Consider Future Impact**:
    -   How does your research fit into the broader field?
    -   What next steps could advance this line of inquiry?

# Summary & Reminders

-   **Must Submit**:
    -   Open Data
    -   Open Materials
    -   Reflective Account
-   **Ask Questions**:
    -   Use lab sessions or discussion forums.
    -   Seek feedback from peers and instructors.
