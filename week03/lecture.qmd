## Key topics today

The week ahead

-   Personal Tutor Meeting about MD this week
-   also Weeks 8 (ethics), 13 (write-up prep), 17 (Stats)
-   Critical Proposal overview and tips
-   Lab preview - Your Critical Proposal Target Paper

## Personal Tutor Meeting Week 3

This week (week 3) you have 50 minutes with your Personal Tutor to
discuss the Mini-Dissertation.

::: callout-tip
Your Personal Tutor is ANOTHER source of guidance and support.

Give them the information they need to best help you on this journey.
:::

> [Dear PTs, "Next week, you are given **no information whatsoever**,
> and are asked to turn up to your session with nothing other than
> perhaps a pen and paper, a big smile, and anticipation of lots of
> exciting research in the making."]{.takeaway}

## Future PT Sessions devoted to the MD

Week 8 - Check on status of Ethics application, and troubleshooting

Week 13 - Session to support Analysis Planning and Writing up/Submission
preparation

Week 17 - Result interpretation, and any concerns arising in the final
phase of the MD

## Please fill in a group on your Lab Miro Board.

Even just your names... Help us to help you. Please.

# Any Questions?

# Being critical and evaluating the work of others

## This is a topic and skill you've already been shown

![](images/paste-6F9D0DD1.png)

Review these materials and consider your performance of the assessment,
and any feedback

## This year Critical Analysis has a 'point'

The objective of the Critical Proposal is that you start to deploy the
tools you have practiced in the service of your Mini-Dissertations.

A 'practical' exercise, which we are giving feedback to once... but that
you will do multiple times for your Mini-Dissertation.

GOAL: to develop some aspect of your study design or methodology.

You will probably follow this process 'a few times' for your final year
dissertation!

## The Four 'Big' Validities

**Internal Validity**: The degree to which an experiment accurately
assesses variable relationships without interference from confounding
factors.

**External Validity**: The degree to which study results can be applied
to different populations or settings, indicating generalizability.

**Construct Validity**: The evaluation of whether a test effectively
measures the intended theoretical construct using multiple indicators.

**Statistical Validity**: The assessment of whether statistical methods
used in data analysis yield accurate conclusions from the data.

## ![](images/paste-D67024A1.png){width="900"}

## Let's look at the example from last week

![](images/paste-18F30242.png)

## How do I do it? \[one approach\]

Review literature on a key part of your 'puzzle' (an IV, a 'tool', the
DV etc)

Apply critical evaluation to carefully chosen paper(s)

Consider how it might realistically guide or inform your own research

Identify a procedure to partially replicate, replicate, or replicate and
extend/improve

Detail how that takes shape and reflect on your confidence, skill base,
perception of value

## or

You could approach it [strategically as a group]{.underline}.

Identify areas to take ownership of, then divide and conquer!

[Or fly solo and agree to later apply the same process to a mutually
beneficial part of your study]{.incremental}

# Critical Proposal Support

## Briefing and Rubric

## Briefing

![](images/Lec03CritPropBrief1-01.png){fig-align="center"}

## Rubric

![](images/Lec03CritPropRubric.png){fig-align="center"}

## Please follow the suggested outline

![](images/Lec03Summaryoutline.png){fig-align="center"}

## Design information

![](images/Thisismydesign.drawio-01.png)

## More tips

-   Please review the "SUGGESTED ESSAY OUTLINE" in the coursework
    briefing
-   No need to follow it roboticly, be strategic & selective in terms of
    details
-   [Selection of a 'good' paper to focus on is an integral part of the
    assessment]{.underline}!
-   Do you think the first google result will be a fruitful paper? No,
    of course you don't!
-   [Use your Lab Tutor and me to get a sense of confidence.
    Early.]{.takeaway}
-   [Tell us how you are searching and what you are looking
    for]{.takeaway}
-   [Confirm the paper with us in a lab session \[Priority given for
    this\]]{.takeaway}

## Even more tips

-   Use some of the tools presented in the previous lab activity to help
    track down a suitable paper

-   Give yourself time to read, review, re-read and select your juiciest
    points

-   Avoid any discussion of methodologies that cannot inform your study
    directly

    -   e.g. Clinical diagnostic procedures, fMRI technicalities,
        Criminal Record or Case Study review procedures

## You can (will) use LOTS of this in your MD!

This isn't a sidetrack exercise. It's a critical step in your project

Note your references, note your main points, be organised

## Weeks 4 & 5

Talking about Variables and the 3 'flavours' of ANOVA in week 4

Week 5 is 'power calculations' and opportunity to discuss CP

But we will be moving on and the CP will be part of your independent
study

Same opportunities for RASA submissions/summer deferrals & resubmissions
