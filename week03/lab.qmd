# Overview of Lab 03

::: callout-note
The objective of today is to immerse yourself in the 'Research Methods'
of your Critical Proposal Target Paper
:::

This may seem like an 'academic' exercise now.. but it is not!

## Reading

• Being able to read a single paper carefully and critically is an
important skill

• Being able to synthesise multiple papers and appreciate similarities
and differences is crucial

• Building on this effort to identify 'gaps' or ways to build on
strengths

## Today

::: callout-note
**Think more carefully about each of the following aspects and jot down
some ideas for your Critical Proposal:**

1\. Design of the study

2\. Participants and recruitment

3\. Materials

4\. Procedure

**And you will need to identify an Effect Size (again) - why not
highlight it now!**
:::

## Remember

::: callout-tip
You can show your Lab Tutor the paper you propose to use for your
Critical Proposal... DO SO!
:::

It needs to be a peer-reviewed empirical paper from the Psychology
literature that presents a quantitative study, includes methods (Design,
Participants, Materials) and analyses the data. Failure to follow these
rules will impact your mark.

## Submit your chosen paper and information on your current group

This is Compulsory by end of the week.
