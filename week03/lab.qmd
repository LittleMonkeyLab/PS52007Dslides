# Overview of Lab 03

::: callout-note
The objective of today is to immerse yourself in the 'Research Methods'
of your Critical Proposal Target Paper
:::

This may seem like an 'academic' exercise now.. but it is not!

## Reading

• Being able to read a single paper carefully and critically is an
important skill

• Being able to synthesise multiple papers and appreciate similarities
and differences is crucial

• Building on this effort to identify 'gaps' or ways to build on
strengths

## Today

::: callout-note
**Think more carefully about each of the following aspects and jot down
some ideas for your Critical Proposal:**

1\. Design of the study

2\. Participants and recruitment

3\. Materials

4\. Procedure

**And you will need to identify an Effect Size (again) - why not
highlight it now!**
:::

## Remember

::: callout-tip
You can show your Lab Tutor the paper you propose to use for your
Critical Proposal... DO SO!
:::

It needs to be a peer-reviewed empirical paper from the Psychology
literature that presents a quantitative study, includes methods (Design,
Participants, Materials) and analyses the data. Failure to follow these
rules will impact your mark.

## Design Schematic

You will be required to complete elements of this diagram and include it
in your Critical Proposal. How much of it could you think about
completing now? (The template can be downloaded on the VLE in the
Coursework Information section, and edited at
