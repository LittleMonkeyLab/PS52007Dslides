# Part 1: Metacognition {background-color="#1c5253"}

## What is Metacognition?

> "Thinking about thinking"

-   Knowledge about cognition
-   Regulation of cognition
-   Self-awareness of learning processes

::: notes
-   Metacognition was first defined by Flavell (1979) as "knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena"
-   It involves both understanding our thought processes and actively controlling them
-   Unlike cognition which processes information, metacognition evaluates and regulates that processing
:::

## The Metacognitive Framework

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Metacognitive Knowledge**

-   Declarative knowledge (knowing what)
-   Procedural knowledge (knowing how)
-   Conditional knowledge (knowing when and why)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Metacognitive Regulation**

-   Planning
-   Monitoring
-   Evaluating
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   This framework comes from Schraw & Moshman (1995)
-   Metacognitive knowledge: What we know about our own cognition
-   Metacognitive regulation: How we control our cognition
-   Both components are essential for effective learning
:::

## Metacognition in Research

-   **Nelson & Narens (1990):** Model of metacognition with monitoring and control

    ![](images/metamemory.png)

-   **Dunlosky & Metcalfe (2008):** Metacognition in educational settings

-   **Fleming & Dolan (2012):** Neural basis of metacognition

::: fragment
*Research indicates metacognitive awareness significantly improves learning outcomes*
:::

::: notes
-   Nelson & Narens developed a foundational model showing how monitoring and control processes interact
-   Dunlosky's work demonstrates how metacognition can be applied to improve study techniques and retention
-   Neuroscience research by Fleming identifies specific brain regions involved in metacognitive processes
:::

## The Psychology Student as Metacognitive Practitioner

-   Self-questioning research methods
-   Evaluating theoretical frameworks
-   Recognizing cognitive biases in your thinking
-   Assessing the quality of evidence

::: notes
-   Psychology students are in a unique position to apply metacognition to their own studies
-   The discipline requires constant critical evaluation of methods and evidence
-   This creates a "meta" level where you're studying psychological processes while using them
:::

## Metacognition and Academic Success

![](images/CleanShot 2025-03-22 at 16.58.52.png)

/

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Students with strong metacognitive skills:**

-   Plan more effectively
-   Monitor comprehension
-   Adjust strategies when needed
-   Reflect on performance
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Research findings:**

-   40% variance in learning outcomes explained by metacognitive awareness (Veenman et al., 2006)
-   Improves transfer of knowledge to new contexts
-   Enhances critical thinking abilities
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Research consistently shows metacognitive abilities are strong predictors of academic success
-   These skills become even more important in higher education settings
-   They're particularly crucial for psychology where critical analysis of evidence is central
:::

# Part 2: Reflection in Learning {background-color="#1c5253"}

## Theoretical Foundations of Reflection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Dewey (1933)** - Reflection as purposeful, systematic thinking - Problem-solving approach
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Schön (1983)** - Reflection-in-action - Reflection-on-action
:::
:::::

::: fragment
**Kolb (1984): Experiential Learning Cycle** - Concrete experience → Reflective observation → Abstract conceptualization → Active experimentation
:::

::: notes
-   John Dewey was one of the first to systematically explore reflection in learning
-   Donald Schön distinguished between reflection during an activity and reflection after completion
-   David Kolb integrated reflection into a complete learning cycle that continues to influence education
:::

## Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (1988)

```{mermaid}

%%| fig-height: 6
flowchart TD
    A[Description\nWhat happened?] --> B[Feelings\nWhat were you thinking?]
    B --> C[Evaluation\nWhat was good/bad?]
    C --> D[Analysis\nWhat sense can you make?]
    D --> E[Conclusion\nWhat else could you have done?]
    E --> F[Action Plan\nIf it happened again, what would you do?]
    F --> A
```

::: notes
-   Gibbs' model provides a structured approach to reflection
-   Each stage prompts different types of thinking
-   This cycle is particularly useful for the CHIP Learning Log
-   Notice how it integrates emotional responses with analytical thinking
:::

## Levels of Reflection

::: nonincremental
1.  **Descriptive reflection** - Reporting what happened
2.  **Dialogic reflection** - Exploring reasons and alternatives
3.  **Critical reflection** - Considering broader contexts and implications
:::

::: fragment
For the CHIP Learning Log, aim for **dialogic** and **critical** reflection
:::

::: notes
-   Based on Hatton & Smith's (1995) taxonomy of reflection
-   Descriptive reflection is necessary but insufficient for university-level work
-   Dialogic reflection shows engagement with different perspectives
-   Critical reflection demonstrates the highest level of academic thinking
:::

## Reflection vs. Academic Writing

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Academic Writing** - Third person - Objective tone - Focus on evidence - Literature-driven
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Reflective Writing** - First person ("I") - Personal perspective - Experience integrated with evidence - Connection between self and theory
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   Many students struggle with the shift between these writing styles
-   Reflective writing still requires academic rigor and evidence
-   The key difference is the integration of personal perspective
-   This is a valuable skill that employers increasingly seek
:::

# Part 3: CHIP Learning Log Requirements {background-color="#1c5253"}

## Overview of CHIP Learning Log

-   Two reflective accounts (600 words each, not including references)
-   Focus on conceptual, historical, and integrative perspectives
-   Personal engagement with course topics
-   Critical thinking, not summarizing

::: fragment
*"The reflections are not summaries of the material (at all - biggest error)"*
:::

::: notes
-   The Learning Log is a significant assessment worth double a standard essay
-   It requires a different approach than other coursework
-   The emphasis is on personal reflection and critical engagement
-   Students often make the mistake of merely summarizing lecture content
:::

## First Reflective Account: Two Perspectives

Choose **two** perspectives from:

::: nonincremental
-   As a **STUDENT** of psychology
-   As a **TRAINEE** psychologist
-   In relation to a **RESEARCH** application
-   As a **HISTORIAN** of psychology
-   Reporting on the **CULTURE or PRACTICE** of psychology
-   As a critic or supporter of psychology's status as a **SCIENCE**
:::

::: notes
-   Your title should clearly indicate which two perspectives you've chosen
-   Each perspective offers a different lens for examining your chosen topic
-   Choose perspectives that genuinely interest you and relate to your aspirations
-   The perspectives should complement each other to create a cohesive reflection
:::

## Example Title and Structure (First Account)

**Title:** "Is Psychology a Science? From the perspectives of: STUDENT/FUTURE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST"

**Structure:** - Introduction: Topic and perspectives - Main body: Explore each perspective - Conclusion: Key insights and implications

::: notes
-   Notice how the title clearly identifies both the topic and the perspectives
-   The structure should be logical and well-organized
-   Each perspective should be given appropriate attention
-   Remember to include references and explain any technical terms
:::

## Second Reflective Account: Learning Journey

-   **Starting point:** Reading, TED Talk, cartoon, video, etc.
-   **Document your exploration:** How understanding evolved
-   **Reflect on experience:** Reactions, assumptions, emotions
-   **Conclude:** Key takeaways and discoveries

::: fragment
*"This is easier if you actually do the thing."*
:::

::: notes
-   The second account traces your intellectual journey on a topic
-   It should show how your understanding developed through engagement with multiple sources
-   The reflection should be authentic - based on real exploration, not fabricated
-   Include your emotional and intellectual responses to what you discovered
:::

## Key Success Strategies

::: nonincremental
1.  Start early - track interesting topics throughout the year
2.  Be authentic - use your actual voice and experiences
3.  Balance personal reflection with academic rigor
4.  Focus on depth rather than breadth
5.  Include relevant references and explain key terms
6.  Stay within the 600-word limit for each account
:::

::: notes
-   Successful reflections demonstrate genuine engagement with the material
-   Many students leave this until after their dissertation, which creates unnecessary pressure
-   The personal nature of reflection doesn't mean abandoning academic standards
-   Brevity is challenging - be concise and focused
:::

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**DON'T:** - Summarize lecture content - Write generically without personal voice - Wait until the last minute - Exceed the word limit
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**DO:** - Critically engage with ideas - Use "I" and personal experiences - Track interesting topics year-round - Be concise and focused
:::
:::::

::: notes
-   The most common mistake is treating this like a content summary
-   Another frequent issue is writing in an impersonal academic style
-   Many students underestimate the time needed for quality reflection
-   Word limits are strict - practice concise expression
:::

## Tone and Style Guidelines

> *"I want to hear your voice, I want to hear your perspective. I want to see you write in a tone and style that helps convey your argument, it is an opportunity to ditch that weird passive voice and use "I"."*

::: fragment
But remember: *"It is NOT an opportunity to be imprecise or write without sources, or to ignore the guidelines."*
:::

::: notes
-   This assessment allows for more personal expression than typical academic work
-   Using "I" appropriately signals authentic reflection
-   Despite the personal tone, maintain academic rigor with sources and precise language
-   Balance personal reflection with scholarly engagement
:::

# Part 4: Metacognition in Practice {background-color="#1c5253"}

## Metacognitive Strategies for Reflection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Before writing:** - Knowledge activation - Goal setting - Strategy selection
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**During writing:** - Comprehension monitoring - Clarity checking - Progress evaluation
:::
:::::

::: fragment
**After writing:** - Performance assessment - Strategy effectiveness review - Future approach planning
:::

::: notes
-   These metacognitive strategies can be applied directly to your reflection process
-   Before writing: Activate what you know, set clear goals, choose appropriate strategies
-   During writing: Monitor your understanding, check clarity, evaluate progress
-   After writing: Assess performance, review strategy effectiveness, plan for future improvements
:::

## Practical Exercise: Metacognitive Reflection

Take 3 minutes to reflect on:

1.  Your current understanding of a potential CHIP topic
2.  Gaps in your knowledge about this topic
3.  Strategies you could use to deepen your understanding
4.  How you might approach the reflection from two perspectives

::: notes
-   This brief exercise demonstrates metacognition in action
-   It helps identify knowledge gaps before they become problematic
-   The process mirrors what you'll need to do for your CHIP Learning Log
-   This type of reflection should become habitual throughout your studies
:::

## Applying Metacognition to CHIP Success

::: nonincremental
-   **Planning:** Choose topics that genuinely interest you
-   **Monitoring:** Track your learning journey in real time
-   **Evaluating:** Assess your reflections against the criteria
-   **Regulating:** Adjust your approach based on feedback
:::

::: fragment
*Strategic metacognition will improve both your learning and your grades*
:::

::: notes
-   Metacognition isn't just a theoretical concept - it's a practical tool
-   Use planning strategies to select meaningful topics early
-   Monitoring helps ensure you're capturing your authentic learning journey
-   Evaluation against criteria keeps you aligned with assessment requirements
-   Regulation allows for improvement based on feedback
:::

:::

## Timeline for CHIP Learning Log

::: nonincremental
-   **Now:** Begin tracking interesting topics and personal responses
-   **Throughout the year:** Collect starting points for your second reflection
-   **After lectures:** Note topics that resonate with you
-   **Before submission:** Review guidelines and check word count
:::

::: fragment
*Remember: "People usually wait until after they submit their Mini-Dissertation before starting thinking about this."*
:::

::: notes
-   Starting early significantly reduces stress and improves quality
-   Creating a habit of reflection throughout the year makes this assignment much easier
-   Use the time after lectures to briefly note topics that interest you
-   The CHIP Learning Log should be an ongoing process, not a last-minute effort
:::

## Final Reminders

::: nonincremental
-   Two accounts, 600 words each (excluding references)
-   First account: Two perspectives on a course topic
-   Second account: Learning journey from a starting point
-   Balance personal voice with academic rigor
-   Previous high scores: 88 (worth double a Cognitive Essay!)
:::

::: notes
-   These are the key points to remember about the CHIP Learning Log
-   The word limit is strict but manageable with focused writing
-   Both accounts require different approaches but similar quality
-   This is a valuable opportunity to achieve a high score if approached properly
-   Remember this is worth double a standard essay in terms of credit
:::
