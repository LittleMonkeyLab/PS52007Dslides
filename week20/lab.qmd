## Welcome to the Final Lab Session

- Last opportunity to ask questions (apart from the FORUM!)
- Review of key resources
- Advice from previous students and lab tutors
- Practical tips for successful completion

## Document Repository Reminder

:::{.callout-important}
Remember to thoroughly review the document repository with the mini-dissertation writing guide!
:::

- Contains comprehensive guidelines for your write-up
- Includes templates, examples, and formatting requirements
- Addresses common questions and concerns
- Will help you avoid common mistakes

## Available Resources

The repository contains numerous valuable resources:

- **Style guides** for academic writing
- **Data Analysis** templates and guidance
- **Tables and Figures** best practices
- **Example MDs** from previous years
- **Rubrics** outlining assessment criteria


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Previous students often struggled with:

- Unclear research questions
- Inadequate literature review
- Poor descriptive tables and weak figures
- Weak connection between results and discussion
- Citation and reference inconsistencies
- Last-minute writing mistakes (start early!)

## Advice from Previous Students

> "Start writing early and in small chunks. Don't wait until you have all your results."

> "Use the templates provided in the repository - they save time and ensure you meet formatting requirements."

> "2,500 words is not as long as you worry it will be at the start or as long as you want it to be at the end!"

## More Student Advice

> "Keep a research journal to track your process and decisions - this is invaluable for the methodology section."

> "Create an outline before you start writing each section. I left it late, so didn't want to over-write"

> "Set aside time for multiple rounds of proofreading and editing. You don't see the words after a while..."

## Lab Tutor Wisdom

- Everyone jumps for low-value limitations (sample size etc) instead of really thinking about it
- Connect your findings back to existing literature
- Follow formatting guidelines precisely

## Writing Process Tips

1. Write the methods section first (easiest when fresh in your mind)
2. Draft results as you analyze data
3. Introduction often comes last (when you know what you're introducing)
4. Allow time for restructuring and revision
5. Have peers review your work (TODAY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON THE PAGE)

## Final Encouragement

You have all the skills and resources needed to succeed!

- Use the repository resources
- Apply the advice shared today
- Manage your time effectively
- Seek help early if needed

**Good luck with your mini-dissertations!**

## From the Lab Tutors
