# Lab Session Overview

## Getting the Feedback You Need

::: callout-important
### You Want Feedback? We're Here to Provide It!

-   Labs are specifically designed for personalized feedback
-   **But feedback is not automatic** â€” you must be proactive:
    -   Identify specific areas where you need support
    -   Prepare targeted questions about your project
    -   Actively approach your lab tutors during sessions
    -   Listen to and implement their advice
    -   Show your work to receive meaningful guidance

**Remember:** After submission is too late for feedback. Many students say they wanted more guidance, yet didn't take advantage of lab opportunities when available.
