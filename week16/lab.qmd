## Important Note on Data

::: callout-warning
### If You Need Fabricated Data

If you were unable to collect sufficient data:

-   Arrange with your lab tutor to use fabricated data
-   You must provide a 4-box set of means and SDs
-   This must be arranged well in advance
-   Document this clearly in your Reflective Account
:::

## Important note on Analysis

::: callout-important
**ALL projects will use 2×2 ANOVA designs**

Your design will be one of the three "flavours":

-   Repeated Measures (within-subjects)
-   Between-Groups (factorial)
-   Mixed Design (combination)
:::

::: callout-warning
**IF YOU USE ANY OTHER ANALYSIS, YOU WON'T SCORE ANY MARKS FOR IT**
:::

## Three Types of ANOVA {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Repeated Measures ANOVA

-   **Design:** Same participants in all conditions
-   **When to use:** Measuring same participants under different conditions
-   **Example:** Testing memory before and after training across two task types
-   **Key advantage:** More statistical power with fewer participants
-   **Key challenge:** Order effects, practice effects
-   **Guide Reference:** pp. 108-111

### Factorial ANOVA

-   **Design:** Different participants in each condition
-   **When to use:** Independent groups for each combination of factors
-   **Example:** Effects of medication (drug vs. placebo) and therapy (yes vs. no)
-   **Key advantage:** No carryover effects
-   **Key challenge:** Requires more participants
-   **Guide Reference:** pp. 101-103

### Mixed ANOVA

-   **Design:** Combines between and within-subjects factors
-   **When to use:** One factor measured repeatedly, another between groups
-   **Example:** Comparing anxiety (pre/post) between treatment and control groups
-   **Key advantage:** Examines interaction between between/within factors
-   **Key challenge:** Most complex analysis of the three
-   **Guide Reference:** pp. 103-107
:::

## ANOVA Assumptions {.smaller}

::: callout-note
Check the Writing Guide pp. 75-84 for detailed procedures for testing assumptions
:::

## Design Assumptions

-   **Independent observations** (observations should not influence each other)
-   **Appropriate measurement level** (dependent variable on interval/ratio scale)
-   **Balanced design** (approximately equal cell sizes when possible)
-   **Complete data** (handle missing data appropriately)

::: callout-tip
These are established through your research design, not statistical tests
:::

## Statistical Assumptions {.smaller}

-   **No significant outliers**
    -   Use boxplots to identify extreme values
    -   Assess impact on results
    -   Writing Guide pp. 77-79
-   **Normality of distribution**
    -   Shapiro-Wilk test (p \> .05 indicates normality)
    -   Q-Q plots
    -   Writing Guide pp. 80-81



## More Statistical Assumptions {.smaller}

-   **Homogeneity of variance** (for between-subjects factors)
    -   Levene's test (p \> .05 indicates equal variances)
    -   Writing Guide p. 81-83
-   **Sphericity** (for repeated measures designs)
    -   Mauchly's test (p \> .05 indicates sphericity)
    -   If violated, use correction (Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt)
    -   Writing Guide p. 83-84

::: callout-warning
**Remember:** Document ALL assumption tests in your Methods/Results section
:::


## Post-Hoc Testing {.smaller}

### When to Use Post-Hoc Tests

1. After finding a significant main effect with **more than two levels**
2. After finding a significant interaction effect
3. To identify which specific group differences drive effects

### Common Post-Hoc Tests

* **Bonferroni correction**: Controls Type I error; conservative but widely accepted; default in most SPSS procedures
* **Tukey's HSD**: Good balance of power and control; for between-subjects comparisons with equal n

## For Interactions

* **Simple effects analysis**: Examine one factor at each level of another; essential for understanding interactions (pp. 105-107)
* **Simple main effects analysis**: Look at differences between groups at each level; helps interpret complex interactions

::: callout-note
See Writing Guide pp. 101-111 for step-by-step guides for post-hoc testing for each ANOVA type
:::

## APA Style Results Reporting {.smaller}

::: callout-tip
### ANOVA Results Template (p. 98 in Writing Guide)

```         
A [repeated-measures/factorial/mixed] ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of [IV1] and [IV2] on [DV]. 
[Assumption tests were conducted with no serious violations noted + details].

There was a [significant/non-significant] main effect of [IV1], F([df1], [df2]) = [F-value], 
p = [p-value], partial η² = [effect size]. 

There was a [significant/non-significant] main effect of [IV2], F([df1], [df2]) = [F-value], 
p = [p-value], partial η² = [effect size].

There was a [significant/non-significant] interaction between [IV1] and [IV2], 
F([df1], [df2]) = [F-value], p = [p-value], partial η² = [effect size].
```
:::

::: callout-note
For significant effects, follow with post-hoc test results, including means, SDs, p-values, and effect sizes where appropriate.
:::

## Common Mistake 1: Forgetting Assumptions Tests {.smaller}

* Don't forget to report the Assumptions tests

**Solution:**

* Report them in your results

## Common Mistake 2: Misinterpreting Interaction Effects {.smaller}

* Focusing only on main effects when interactions are significant
* Missing the most important part of your findings

**Solution:**

* Use post-hocs to understand the pattern and report EMMs

**Mini-dissertation tip:**

* Use interaction plots to visualize and aid interpretation


## Common Mistake 3: Poor Visualization {.smaller}

* Figures don't clearly show patterns and results
* Raw SPSS output used instead of APA-formatted figures

**Solution:**

* Create clear, APA-style visualizations
* Focus on communicating key findings visually

**Mini-dissertation tip:**

* Start creating draft figures immediately after analysis
* Use the Writing Guide examples as templates (pp. 117-121)


## Common Mistake 4: Time Management {.smaller}

* Leaving work to the last minute
* Underestimating supplementary materials workload

**Solution:**

* Create a detailed week-by-week plan
* Set personal deadlines ahead of final submission

**Mini-dissertation tip:**

* Remember that the 2,500 word limit is tight for concise writing
* Allow substantial time for supplementary materials

---

## Common Mistake 5: Statistical Reporting Errors {.smaller}

* Missing degrees of freedom
* Inconsistent decimal places and italics
* Omitting effect sizes

**Solution:**

* Follow APA style guidelines strictly
* Use the templates provided in the Writing Guide

**Mini-dissertation tip:**

* Double-check all F-statements, t-tests, and p-values
* Review the statistical reporting templates (p. 98)

---

## Common Mistake 6: Incomplete Submissions {.smaller}

* Missing required components
* Poorly documented Open Data/Materials

**Solution:**

* Create a comprehensive submission checklist
* Review all requirements before submitting

* Verify all four components are complete (APA report, Open Data, Open Materials, Reflective Account)


## Next Steps {.smaller}

**📋 To-Do Before Next Lab:**

-   Complete ANOVA analyses for your mini-dissertation
-   Create draft figures of your results
-   Prepare summary of your findings
-   Bring questions about interpretation to Lab 17

::: callout-warning
## Important Reminder

Remember that the 2,500 word limit must cover introduction, method, results and discussion. Be concise and focused in your writing.

The supplementary materials (Open Data, Open Materials, Reflective Account) are mandatory but do not count toward the word limit.
