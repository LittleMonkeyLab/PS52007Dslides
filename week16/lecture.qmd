# Now let's quickly discuss CHIP

## CHIP Assignment(s)

::: incremental
-   Coursework piece designed to allow you to engage reflexively with
    the 'big picture' of your degree

-   Think about how these issues link into psychology as a discipline,
    and how they relate to your own thoughts about what psychology is or
    should be

-   Two 'reflective accounts' of max 600 words each (Not including
    obligatory reference list)

-   [**Marks are awarded for reflection**]{.underline}, evidence of
    learning and bring topics together. Please see marking criteria for
    both accounts.

-   Not looking for a restatement of the facts in the lectures etc.

-   [**They are designed to be personal and reflective -- embrace this
    aspect!**]{.underline}
:::

## Reflective Account 1

Essay 1 is based on the content of ONE of the topics and should adopt at
least two of the following 6 'perspectives'.

::: incremental
-   As a **STUDENT** of psychology

-   As a **TRAINEE** psychologist

-   In relation to a **RESEARCH** application in your future

-   As an **HISTORIAN** of psychology

-   Reporting on the culture or **PRACTICE** of psychology as it
    currently exists here or across cultures

-   As a critic or supporter of psychology's status as a **SCIENCE**
:::

## Reflective Account 1 tips

::: incremental
-   Ask a specific question -- and answer it.
-   Intro, body, conclusion structure.
-   Reflect on the topic and give your own opinion as to the answer!
-   Present a journey in your learning or appreciation of the topic
-   Ensure your answer is argued using examples
-   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do
    some strategic wider reading
-   Present and reference it well
:::

## Reflective Account 2

Essay 2 should focus on at least one of the OTHER topics covered in the
course.

::: incremental
-   This answer should focus on a primary reading and then any further
    reading you have done (strongly encouraged).
-   You must identify that primary reading explicitly in the essay
    itself.
-   You should not simply restate what the authors thought or found, but
    rather briefly summarise and build
-   Think about your perspective on the issues.
-   What do you think about this debate or issue? We want to know!
-   And what do you think are interesting directions for psychologists
    to take this debate or issue in the future?
:::

## Reflective Account 2 tips

::: incremental
-   Explicitly identify a single initial reading and build upon that.
-   Discuss a debate or issue that you think is interesting or important
-   Give your own opinion and how this has developed or changed as a
    result of the lecture, the course more widely, and/or the reading.
-   Argue your opinion explicitly, own it and back it up with examples
-   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do
    some strategic wider reading
-   Present and reference it well
:::

## Overlapping content

::: incremental
-   You can combine across different topics in Essay 2 (e.g., you could
    talk about Evolution and Consciousness, or Inclusivity and Science),
    and thinking about links between topics is strongly encouraged.
-   However, the material covered in Essay 2 must be different from
    Essay 1. Students will be penalised for covering identical topics.

## Details

::: incremental
-   Due: Friday, 12 April 2024, 12:00 Noon - about 3 weeks after the end
    of term

-   n.b. Mini-Dissertation Due: Friday, 22 March 2024, 12:00 Noon

-   Both answers should be written in essay-style prose (e.g., with APA
    references where you refer to sources) put in a single document and
    submitted to the coursework submission page.

-   Max 600 words per answer (references not included in word count)

-   Remember that this only accounts for a smaller portion of the module
    grade (15%). Should hopefully be an enjoyable way to reflect on
    issues on the course you found interesting.
