# Overview of today's lab activities

1.  If you wish to use the Study Swap, for sharing your study with the
    rest of Year 2, please send the relevant information to Gordon

2.  Start recruiting participants or participating. If you have not yet
    got Ethical Approval, do not worry.

3.  Review the first chapter of the Dissertation Write-up Guide and
    start planning the rest of term.

## Study Swap

# Study Swap Shop

Please try to actively recruit for your studies, whether in person or
online.

We are happy to host a list of links on the VLE, so that you can take
part in studies designed by other groups. This is on an honour-basis.
Please take part in as many as you are able.

If you wish your study to be listed send the following information to
Gordon.

## Study Swap example

Send a short informative title, the anticipated duration of your task,
any inclusion or exclusion criteria, and the URL.Â

## Start recruiting (or participating)

The labs (as usual) are flexible working time. Please feel free to ask
your colleagues to take part in your study, or take part in studies
yourself.

Remember, by seeing what other students did under the same constraints
as you will be a useful learning experience. If you have any questions
or queries, or if you feel that there are elements you wish to know more
about, contact the researcher.

Maybe think about collecting any good ideas, or nice debriefs etc. Why
start from scratch next year?

## Mini-Dissertation Write-up Guide

Over the next 10 weeks, a comprehensive set of guidelines will be
provided, focusing on APA7 format, report writing, data export, prep and
analysis, as well as curation of Open Materials and Open Data.

It's never too early to start writing.

writing.
