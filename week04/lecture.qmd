# Any Questions?

# Critical Proposal

There is an example of a previous first class submission, with
annotations, available on the VLE in the Critical Proposal Coursework
section of the VLE. Please read it carefully and attend to the comments.

# A quick word on the MD Research Topic & Designs

Your individual Mini-Dissertation project **MUST** conform to the
following definitive rules:

::: nonincremental
-   **2x2 ANOVA design with 2 categorical IVs (each with 2 levels) and a
    single continuous DV**
-   MORE ON THIS NEXT WEEK!
-   **You must obtain ethical approval and show individual involvement
    in the process of application**
-   **You must make a sample size estimation / Power calculation**
-   **You must contribute to group recruitment and data collection
    efforts either online or in-person**
:::

## Mini-Dissertation Submission

**Your Mini-Dissertation final submission must comprise ALL of the
following COMPULSORY elements:**

::: nonincremental
-   a 2,500 word APA7 empirical paper with a complete reference list and
    appendices
-   Open Data - a single, cleaned, clearly-labelled data set
-   Open Materials - a complete, replication-ready materials package
    detailing materials relevant to your individual write-up
-   A reflective account covering the Mini-Dissertation (not a moan
    about your group or strikes or having to do research)
:::

## Recap of 2x2

### 3 'flavours' of 2x2 ANOVA

**2bx2b** - Between-subjects/Factorial ANOVA

**2wx2w** - Within-subject/Repeated Measures ANOVA

**2bx2w** or **2wx2b** - Mixed ANOVA

Formalise your individual design

![](images/paste-B1D55680.png)

## More specific

![](images/paste-96A3FF92.png)

## How you blend 2x2 designs as a group

Let's say your group was interested in Academic Self-Handicapping and
features of personality and academic background contributing to this
phenomenon.

It makes sense that the bulk of the efforts of your group go in to
measuring Academic Self-Handicapping.

## Individual 2x2

**The effect of Conscientiousness and Self-Efficacy on Academic
Self-Handicapping**

::: incremental
-   *The effect of Independent Variable A and Independent Variable B on
    a continuous Dependent Variable* 
-   Conscientiousness IV(A1) Low or IV(A2) high - Independent Variable
    IV(A)
-   Self-Efficacy IV(B1) Low or IV(B2) high - Independent Variable IV(B)
-   Academic Self-Handicapping (ASH score, 'continuous' Dependent
    Variable DV)
-   What about the other 2 people in the group?
:::

## Rest of the group:

**The effect of IV(A) and IV(B) on Academic Self-Handicapping** 

::: incremental
1.  Other Personality Traits (e.g. Procrastination, Neuroticism)

2.  Other attributes (e.g. A-Level Psychology, Maths Anxiety, Academic
    Role Model)

-   Not too complicated, right?
-   Can you see the economies of effort and implicit support
    opportunities?
:::

## Overall data collection

-   IV(A) Conscientiousness Questionnaire
-   IV(B) Self-Efficacy Measure
-   \(DV\) Academic Self-Handicapping Test
-   (+) Procrastination as IV(B) (Person 2 complete)
-   (\~) Person 3 Procrastination - IV(A)/Self-Efficacy - IV(B) & ASH
    (Person 3 done)

## If you develop a more elaborate 'task'

such as a memory test, with easy and difficult stimuli sets

-   This is a 2-level IV already (let's call it IV(B)
-   Group members could either
    -   Swap in different personality measures or attributes as IV(B)
    -   OR look at different DVs (Accuracy, Error, Confidence, Speed,
        reported difficulty)
    -   OR you could overlay another IV - to introduce practice (but
        this may slightly separate datasets meaning more data would be
        required (could be conceived as a poorer or better planned
        design!)

## Do not expect yourself to be able to solve this now

-   Once we come back after reading week, and we start building, you
    will know more about your chosen topic.
-   You will have an idea of preferred methods
-   Your PT and LT will be able to refine and discuss ideas
-   The Build and Ethics Submission are both points which we can be
    utterly certain your design works and is achievable
-   This is why you need to talk, keep notes, and should be strategic
    with the Critical Proposal

# It's almost time to get practical

## 'Operationalisation' of variables

Operationalisation of variables requires a consideration of the
reliability and validity of the method of operationalisation.

Operationalisation of variables also requires specification of the scale
of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.

Finally, operationalisation of variables can also specify details of the
measurement procedure.

See Howitt and Cramer Chapter 3.3 (Box Research Example - Condon & Crano
1988)

## Attitude similarity and interpersonal attraction

![](images/paste-01E3BCC9.png)

## Their DV (consider pros and cons)

This person would like (dislike) me

This person would like (dislike) working with me in an experiment

## The Student Room (question)

## The Student Room (answer 1)

## The Student Room (answer 2)

![](images/paste-776290A0.png)

## Of great importance that you reflect on this for your MD too

How have you [defined]{.underline} your variables of interest?

-   IVs and DVs

How have you [measured or categorised]{.underline} your variables of
interest?

-   e.g. Social Media use

-   Gender

-   Frequency or low/high extraversion

## **The research process**

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
-   Develop research aims 
-   Specify research questions/hypotheses related to these aims
-   Identify relevant constructs and concepts 
-   Translate constructs and concepts into variables (i.e., a logical
    set of characteristics/features)
-   Translate variables into measurements (i.e., the quantification of
    characteristics/features)
:::

## Quantitative Research

A systematic examination of relationships between variables

. . .

'Variables' are 'translated' from concepts, constructs or phenomena

. . .

Could be critiqued as 'reductionist'

## Types of Variable

Independent Variable

-   Experimental - The variable [I]{.shout} manipulate

-   Non-Experimental / Quasi-Experimental - Comparison between
    pre-existing groups

Dependent Variable

-   The variable you measure, that you propose to be influenced by a
    manpulation of the IVs
-   The \[D\]ata{.shout}

## Types of Measurement

Nominal/Categorical

-   Male/Female/...

-   Vegan / Vegetarian

-   Smoker/Non-Smoker

## Types of Measurement

Ordinal

Numbers representing a rank position in a group

Not representative of an actual definite number/score/value - without
information about the 'gap' between numbers

-   First, second, third

-   Tallest/Shortest

## Types of Measurement

Interval

Numbers represent equal units giving information about the 'gap' between
numbers

-   Temperature

-   Psychological Scales

## Types of Measurement

Ratio

Interval measurements with an absolute zero, of equal units,

-   Weight

-   Length

-   Time/Reaction time\*

## Median Splits

'Cutting' a distribution in half at the mid-point - with 50% on each
side of the cut

## Median Splits can be considered problematic

::: callout-warning
## Beware!

We often suggest a median split to dichotomise a continuous variable,
e.g. for the purposes of creating a 2 level IV.

It's a useful exercise in calculating a 'computed variable' in SPSS or
Jamovi

It is NOT best-practice usually. Why not?
:::

It is a key learning outcome that you are able to perform a standardised
analysis, specifically, the 2x2 ANOVA with any necessary assumption
checks and post-hocs + plots

## Think about this

## Operationalisation, measurement and definitions impact...

## Summary

You should think carefully about:

-   How you define your variables - this is probably a part of the
    introduction that students DON'T think about enough

-   How you measure or categorise your variables (IVs and DVs) - this is
    probably the single thing I look at first when peer-reviewing
    research!

-   How well your manipulation does what it claims to. Does you
    manipulation bring the thing it proposed to to life well?

# Running Experiments online or face to face

## Comparing Experiment Modalities

-   Online Surveys and Experiments
    -   Qualtrics - For surveys, stimulus presentation that don't
        require accurate timing
    -   Gorilla.sc - For 'experimental' tasks with complex stimulus \>
        presentation or that require response time measures or
        push-button \> responses etc.
-   Face-to-Face Experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Online Surveys and Experiments with Qualtrics

### Overview

-   A powerful tool for creating and distributing online surveys
-   Widely used in psychological research
-   We have an institutional licence and so it is FREE
-   No specialist support - has excellent online support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Qualtrics (or online surveys)

### Accessibility

-   Reach a wide, diverse audience (if necessary)
-   Accessible by anyone with a phone or laptop etc

### Cost-Effective

-   Low 'cost' compared to face-to-face

### Data Management

-   Automated data collection, scoring and storage
-   Relatively easy to analyze and export data - but not always simple

### Customization

-   Highly customizable surveys and experiments (video, photos, audio,
    vignettes)
-   Supports various question types and logic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Qualtrics

### Limited Human Interaction

-   Lack of personal interaction can affect responses
-   You put a huge amount of trust in the participant
-   Not always easy to manage ethical challenges properly

### Technical Issues

-   Dependence on internet connectivity and user tech skills
-   An error in the build and you are in trouble \####

## Cons of Qualtrics (continued)

### Response Authenticity

-   Higher risk of dishonest or inattentive responses (maybe?)\

#### Sampling Bias

-   Potential for non-representative samples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to experiments using Gorilla.sc

### Gorilla.sc: highly controlled online Psychological Research

-   A comprehensive online tool for behavioral research
-   Facilitates creation, deployment, and analysis of experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Features of Gorilla.sc

### User-Friendly Interface

-   Intuitive design for researchers of all levels
-   Drag-and-drop experiment builder

### Requires 'tokens' to run

-   You will need to apply for 'tokens' to apply for ethics, and to run
    the study.
-   There is usually a limited supply as there is a cost associated with
    this.

### Versatile Experiment Design

-   Supports a wide range of experimental paradigms
-   Customizable to suit various research needs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experiment Creation with Gorilla.sc

### Building Blocks

-   Use 'widgets' and 'tasks' to construct experiments
-   Easily integrate surveys, quizzes, and cognitive tasks

### Advanced Customization

-   Incorporate complex experimental logic
-   Customize with CSS and JavaScript for unique requirements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Real-Time Data Collection

-   Gather data securely and efficiently
-   Access participant responses in real-time

### Analytical Tools

-   Built-in tools for basic data analysis
-   Export data for advanced analysis in other software e.g. SPSS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Collaboration and Sharing

### Team Collaboration

-   Share experiments and data with team members
-   Collaborate on experiment design and analysis

### Participant Recruitment

-   Still needs to be managed via sources outside of Gorilla

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gorilla.sc in Psychological Research

### Broad Application

-   Suitable for cognitive, social, and clinical psychology
-   Ideal for remote and large-scale studies

### Impact on Mini-Dissertations

-   Increases the reach of psychological studies requiring complex
    stimulus or timing
-   Not easy to get up and running with this tool
-   No specialist support - has excellent templates and online support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Face-to-Face Experiments

### Overview

-   Traditional method of conducting experiments
-   Involves direct interaction with participants

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Face-to-Face Experiments

### Enhanced Interaction

-   Direct human interaction enriches data quality

### Controlled Environment

-   Better control over experimental conditions

### Immediate Feedback

-   Opportunity for immediate clarification and feedback

### Participant Authenticity

-   Lower risk of false responses (maybe?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Face-to-Face Experiments

### Higher Costs

-   Greater resource and time investment (maybe?)

### Limited Reach

-   Restricted to participants' geographical location

### Time-Consuming

-   Scheduling and conducting sessions takes time

### Potential Biases

-   Risk of experimenter or social desirability biases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

### Choosing the Right Method

-   Depends on research goals, resources, and target population
-   Both methods offer unique advantages and challenges

### Tailoring to Research Needs

-   Consider the nature of your study and participant accessibility
-   Balance between quality, 'cost', and reach

------------------------------------------------------------------------
