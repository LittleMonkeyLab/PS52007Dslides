# Overview of Lab 04

## Keep progressing your Critical Proposals

-   Get your Target Paper checked by your Lab Tutor Is it still the best
    you can do?
-   Have a look at the sample Critical Proposal in the Coursework
    Information section of the VLE.
-   It got a first, but there was plenty of room for improvement.
-   Last year the Effect Size information and Design Schematic were not
    required. This year, they ARE COMPULSORY.

## If you are happy with your Critical Proposal

-   You can use the lab time to continue refining your research ideas.

-   Start identifying and documenting your IVs and DVs. Maybe even your
    design!

## Your Design

How much of the Design of your study is known at this point?
