## A bit about me...

::: tiny
-   Formerly worked in the advertising industry for top London agencies
-   Impulsively started a Psych degree in 2006 (age 30+)

## But first

::: {.incremental .small}
-   The importance of your 'participation'
-   If you don't engage, it is difficult to respond to your needs
-   I want you to find **Your Psychology - NOT MINE!**
-   Easier to keep up than catch-up
-   We have numerous safeguards in place to protect you this year, but
    be your own best friend
-   The only thing that should be worried this year becoming a
    Psychology bore!

# Module Overview

## Module weighting and assessment

Research Methods is a 30 credit weighted module. As I always say, a
coursework essay, say for Cognitive Psychology, is worth 1/10th of your
Mini-Dissertation. It does NOT make sense to miss a lab working on an
essay that might not even count towards your grade.

To pass, you must pass all 3 assessment elements:

::: callout-note
Critical Proposal 1,800 words (15%)

Mini-Dissertation 2,500 words (70%)

CHIP Learning Log 1,200 words (15%)
:::

## Indicative Critical Proposal Support

![](images/CPsupport.png)

## You aren't spectators any more, you're Scientists!

In small groups of 3 or 4 people, you will:

::: small
::: incremental
-   Identify an area of psychological research
-   Review and critique the literature in this area (Critical Proposal)
-   Develop a testable hypothesis
-   Design a 2x2 ANOVA experiment unique to you (within your group
    study)
-   Obtain Ethical Approval for your experiment
-   Collect REAL data
-   Analyse these data
-   Write up the results in APA format with Open Data and Materials
    (Mini-Diss)
-   Reflect on your learning and development journey (CHIP Learning Log)
:::
:::

## Consider it a 'warm up' for your Y3 Dissertation

::: small
-   The same 20-week timeline
-   The same skills and techniques you will need
-   Careful step-by-step guidance and support in the lab setting
-   Scaled-down experiments and write-ups - but all the same moving
    parts
-   The security of working in a group
-   Tips and advice from world-class researchers
-   Opportunities to think carefully about your final year Dissertation,
    and how to crush it!!
:::

## Support and guidance

::: incremental
-   Gordon (Module Coordinator and [Enthusiast in Chief]{.shout})
-   3 gobsmackingly amazing Lab Tutors
-   Your Mini-Dissertation group (3 or 4)
-   Your Personal Tutor
-   Your PT group
-   The entire Goldsmiths Research Community!
:::

This is a team-sport

## Access to me

I will be in every Research Methods lecture and i visit **EVERY LAB,
EVERY WEEK!**

**Available at g.wright\@gold.ac.uk and my office is WB200/2**

I genuinely could not imagine anything I would rather do that this. So
please talk to me and help me get to know you!

Questions relating to Module Content must be asked via the Forum. There
will be no exceptions.

## A friendly warning

::: callout-warning
## Warning

All coursework is [INDIVIDUAL]{.shout} and subject to normal plagiarism
and collusion rules.

Just don't risk it. Be mindful of how you read, take notes and share
coursework.

See previous information about the use of AI. It can be a wonderful
tool, but do NOT use it for the wholesale production of written content.
It must be a support, not a shortcut. You'll regret it.
:::

## Module structure

1 x 1 hr Lecture per week (Monday 11-12 PSH LG02 (winter term))

1 x 2 hr Lab per week (Tuesday - see personal timetable)

4 x Personal Tutor meetings across the year

## Weekly Structure

Each week there will be a very brief '**Overview to set out the main
topics and to give you a set of milestones or preparatory activities**'
designed to keep you on track.

**Lecture** (slides available in advance from week 03 onwards!)

**Lab**

-   **Lab Notes** - find a solution that works for you, but make sure
    that you have it every week, so a cloud-based system would be best.
    You will be expected to show notes of your progress to your Lab
    Tutor and show specifics when asking questions
-   Lots can be achieved in the labs, but independent study and
    coordinated group work will be required. We will be asking about
    this aspect of the process regularly.

## Coursework

The courseworks ALL require critical reflection and meta-cognitive
practice. This will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it
contributes to effective learning and your integration of the skills and
experience of doing this research exercise.

## Time management and teamwork

..will both be required.

I ask you to see both as an opportunity to develop these important
skills.

You will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers
and employability

It is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.

## Resources

We will be releasing a series of valuable resources to help you through
every step of the process

These will have value for your final year dissertation too.

Contribution to and comment on these is welcome and hoped for!

Open Educational Resources will be used extensively, and most core
readings are available online via the library.

## Before tomorrow, please...

Add an email signature to your college email, including your student
number, programme, lab tutor, and personal tutor. It will speed up
responses to any emails you send to staff.

## Mini-Dissertation structure

Your individual Mini-Dissertation project **MUST** conform to the
following definitive rules:

::: nonincremental
-   **2x2 ANOVA design with 2 categorical IVs (each with 2 levels) and a
    single continuous DV**
-   MORE ON THIS NEXT WEEK!
-   **You must obtain ethical approval and show individual involvement
    in the process of application**
-   **You must make a sample size estimation / Power calculation**
-   **You must contribute to group recruitment and data collection
    efforts either online or in-person**
:::

## Mini-Dissertation Submission

**Your Mini-Dissertation final submission must comprise ALL of the
following COMPULSORY elements:**

::: nonincremental
-   a 2,500 word APA7 empirical paper with a complete reference list and
    appendices
-   Open Data - a single, cleaned, clearly-labelled data set
-   Open Materials - a complete, replication-ready materials package
    detailing materials relevant to your individual write-up
-   A reflective account covering the Mini-Dissertation (not a moan
    about your group or strikes or having to do research)
:::

## Illustrative MD topics

::: nonincremental
-   The effect of gender stereotype and task difficulty on memory
    performance
-   The role of facial symmetry and filter type on ratings of
    attractiveness of online dating profile pictures
-   Exposure to negative news media, trait anxiety and the BAME
    community under COVID-19
-   The effects of Agentic and Communal Narcissism, attitudes towards
    COVID-19 and lockdown compliance
-   The effect of personality and sleep disturbance on academic
    performance
-   Need for cognition, pre-sentencing information and perceptions of
    guilt in a jury decision making task
:::

## But let's deep dive this one

[**The effect of Conscientiousness and Caffeine intake on Academic
Self-Handicapping**]{.takeaway}

::: incremental
-   *The effect of Independent Variable A and Independent Variable B on
    a continuous Dependent Variable* 
-   Conscientiousness IV(A1) Low or IV(A2) high - Independent Variable
    IV(A)
-   Caffeine intake IV(B1) Low or IV(B2) high - Independent Variable
    IV(B)
-   Academic Self-Handicapping (6 item 1-5 Likert style, 'continuous'
    Dependent Variable DV)
-   What about the other 3 people in the group?
:::

## Rest of the group:

[**The effect of Conscientiousness and Caffeine intake on Academic
Self-Handicapping**]{.takeaway} 

::: incremental
1.  [Extraversion]{.underline} (Low/High) & Sleep (Sound/Disturbed) on
    [ASH]{.underline} 
2.  [Openness to experience]{.underline} (Low/High) & Family Attitude to
    Education (Pro/Con) on [ASH]{.underline} 
3.  [Neuroticism]{.underline} (Low/High) & Attitude to Feedback
    (Open/Sensitive) on [ASH]{.underline}
    -   Not too complicated, right?
    -   Can you see the economies of effort and implicit support
        opportunities?
:::

## Lab 01

::: incremental
-   Scan your attendance, sit in your Personal Tutor groups to start
-   Very serious and academically important first activity
-   Start brainstorming ideas for research topics for your
    Mini-Dissertation.
-   Consider 'how' you want to work this year, and who you want to work
    with
-   Detailed information in Lab 01 worksheet, but allow the Lab Tutor to
    guide you and try to get involved!
:::

## Please don't get hung up on topic selection

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Tip

You might think coming up with a research topic is a difficult thing.
For this year, it is NOT super-important. Your Lab Tutors will be
available to help you make sure it's feasible, challenging enough but
not too difficult etc.

It does help if you are interested in it though, as it will help keep
motivation up!

If in doubt.. What about Academic Success? What aspects of personality,
lifestyle, behaviour, attitude, life history etc contribute to it? And
how on earth do you measure Academic Success?
:::

## Please don't get hung up on 'Stats-Panic' or fear of failing

::: callout-warning
Trying to ignore 'stats' is silly. Stats takes up about 3/4 of the lab
in week 16. Seriously.

And don't be afraid of failing. You can only fail if you don't attend
and don't submit all 3 coursework elements.

I thought I might have magical properties, like a troll. The people who
pass are names I associate with faces. The people who fail tend to just
be names on a list. Am I magic?
:::

## Advance warning

::: callout-important
You will confirm your group members (3 or 4), a group name (puns
encouraged), and maybe a topic area in the first half hour of Lab 02.

**There will be no more time available.**

That gives you over a week to sort it out! This is your first
independent study task!
:::

## Some things to consider

::: callout-caution
## Caution

-   Picking something without much of a literature behind it can make
    life VERY difficult

-   We will try to make sure things remain manageable, we are not trying
    to 'restrict' you

-   You will not be able to do research (I think understandably)...

    ::: incremental
    -   on Children
    -   on Vulnerable or protected groups
    -   using methods that require extensive training or specialist
        facilities (e.g. EEG, TMS)
    -   that raises anything more than minimal ethical considerations
    -   for which recruitment will be too onerous or time-consuming

## On behalf of the whole teaching team

Have a wonderful year!
