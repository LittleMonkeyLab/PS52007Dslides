## The Structure of Scientific Revolutions

### Thomas Kuhn (1962)

#### Understanding Scientific Change & Progress

![Historical image of Thomas Kuhn](images/ThomasKuhn.jpeg)

## Legacy

-   One of the most influential books about science ever written
-   Revolutionized how we think about scientific progress
-   Key relevance for psychology and cognitive science today

## Key Concepts We'll Cover

-   Normal Science & Paradigms
-   Scientific Revolutions & Crisis
-   Incommensurability
-   Case Studies from History of Science
-   Applications to Psychology
-   Modern Relevance (AI Revolution)

## What is Normal Science?

-   Scientists working within an accepted framework
-   "Puzzle-solving" activities
-   Based on shared assumptions and methods
-   Example: Current cognitive psychology research paradigm
-   Textbooks play crucial role in maintaining normal science

## Paradigms: The Core Concept

A paradigm is:

-   Shared worldview within scientific community
-   Set of exemplary solutions/methods
-   Framework for what counts as legitimate problems
-   Not just theory - includes practices, tools, values

## Paradigms

> "Scientists work from models acquired through education & subsequent exposure to the literature often without quite knowing or needing to know what characteristics have given these models the status of community paradigms"

## Components of a Paradigm

1.  Symbolic generalizations (e.g., F=ma)
2.  Metaphysical commitments
3.  Values
4.  Exemplars (concrete problem solutions)

## Diagram

## Case Study: The Copernican Revolution

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Pre-Copernican paradigm: Earth-centered universe
-   Anomalies accumulated over time
-   Copernicus proposed radical alternative
-   Resistance from established community
-   Eventually led to complete worldview change

## Scientific Crisis

-   Accumulation of anomalies
-   Existing paradigm cannot explain new findings
-   Loss of confidence in current methods
-   Proliferation of competing theories
-   Example in Psychology: Behaviorism crisis

## Scientific Revolutions

-   Paradigm shift occurs
-   "Scientific revolution" = complete perspective change
-   Not just new knowledge - new way of seeing
-   Cannot be reduced to rule-following
-   Involves conversion experience

## Incommensurability

-   Different paradigms cannot be directly compared
-   Use different concepts, see different things
-   Communication difficulties between paradigms
-   No neutral observation language
-   Example: Behaviorist vs Cognitive descriptions

## Historical Case Study: Chemistry Revolution

-   Phlogiston theory vs Oxygen theory
-   Lavoisier's new paradigm
-   Changed basic concepts of element/compound
-   Transformed experimental practices
-   Parallel to modern psychology shifts?

## Psychology's Paradigm Shifts: A Deeper Look

## 1. Introspectionism (1879-1920s)

-   Wundt's experimental psychology
-   Focus on conscious experience
-   Structured self-observation methods
-   Titchener's systematic introspection
-   Crisis: Unreliable results, lack of replication

## 2. Behaviorism (1920s-1960s)

-   Watson's rejection of consciousness
-   Observable behavior only
-   Stimulus-response mechanisms
-   Skinner's radical behaviorism
-   Crisis: Cannot explain language, thought, memory

## The Behaviorist Paradigm in Detail

## Key Assumptions

-   Mind is a "black box"
-   Learning through conditioning
-   Environmental determinism
-   Rejection of mental states

## Methods

-   Animal studies

-   Quantitative measurement

## The Cognitive Revolution (1950s-1960s)

## Catalysts

-   Information theory development
-   Computer science emergence
-   Memory research breakthroughs

## Key Figures

-   Jerome Bruner
-   George Miller
-   Ulric Neisser
-   Donald Broadbent

## Key Critics & Alternative Views

### Philosophy of Science after Kuhn

-   Kuhn's work sparked major debates
-   Three key alternative perspectives:
    -   Karl Popper: Falsificationism
    -   Imre Lakatos: Research Programs
    -   Paul Feyerabend: Epistemological Anarchism

## "Critical!"

![Philosophy debate illustration](images/Philosophy debate illustration.jpeg)

## Karl Popper's Falsificationism

-   Science advances through bold conjectures and refutations
-   No amount of evidence can prove a theory true
-   But one counterexample can prove it false
-   Focus on crucial experiments that could falsify theories
-   Criticized Kuhn's "normal science" as too dogmatic

## Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence

![Popper portrait and falsification diagram](images/Popper portrait and falsification diagram.jpeg)

## Popper vs Kuhn

### Popper

-   Science should actively seek falsification
-   Clear demarcation between science and non-science
-   Progress through rational criticism

## Kuhn

-   Scientists typically defend paradigms
-   No clear demarcation criteria
-   Progress through revolution and conversion

## Imre Lakatos: Research Programs

-   Attempted synthesis between Kuhn and Popper
-   Science organized into "Research Programs" with:
    -   "Hard core" of fundamental assumptions
    -   "Protective belt" of auxiliary hypotheses
    -   Positive and negative heuristics

## Imre Lakatos

![](images/ImreLakatos.jpeg)

## Progressive vs Degenerating Programs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Progressive Programs

-   Make novel predictions
-   Explain new phenomena
-   Generate new research
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Degenerating Programs

-   Only explain known facts
-   Make ad hoc modifications
-   Lose predictive power
:::
:::::

## Paul Feyerabend: Against Method

-   Rejected both Kuhn and Popper
-   "Anything goes" in scientific method
-   Science shouldn't be privileged over other forms of knowledge
-   Progress requires breaking all rules
-   Advocated theoretical anarchism

## Punk Paul

![Feyerabend portrait](images/Feyerabend portrait.jpeg)

## Feyerabend's Critique of Kuhn

-   Paradigms can and should coexist
-   No single scientific method
-   Progress through proliferation of theories
-   Science needs external criticism
-   Democracy over expert authority

## Relevance for Psychology

### Key Questions

1.  Is psychology falsifiable? (Popper)
2.  What are our research programs? (Lakatos)
3.  Should we embrace methodological pluralism? (Feyerabend)
4.  How do these views inform current debates?

## Discussion Questions

1.  Are we currently in a paradigm crisis in psychology?
2.  How does AI challenge our understanding of mind?
3.  What would constitute evidence of a paradigm shift?
4.  Can multiple paradigms coexist productively?
5.  How should psychology education adapt?

## Key Takeaways

1.  Science progresses through paradigm shifts
2.  Psychology has experienced multiple revolutions
3.  AI may represent current paradigm crisis
