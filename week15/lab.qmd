# Lab 15 

## Priority for Lab 15: Achieving Ethical Approval

* Must achieve ethical approval as part of group
* Required to pass the module
* No exceptions

## Timeline & Next Steps

### After Reading Week:
* Data preprocessing begins
* Data analysis starts

### Warning:
* Organizing data collection after reading week will:
   * Waste valuable lab time
   * Reduce ability to follow along with resources
   * Impact your learning experience

## Key Resources Available

* Mini dissertation writing guide
* Support from lab tutors - it will get busier as people 'return'

## Action Points

### If You Have Limited Data:
* Raise this with lab tutors immediately
* Don't wait until after reading week
* Seek guidance on data collection strategies

### For All Students:
* Review ethical approval requirements
* Ensure all group members understand their roles
* Check data collection progress and report to lab tutors

## Supporting Your Success

* Lab tutors available for guidance (in labs)
* Resources continuously available
* Focus on meeting key deadlines
* Prioritize ethical approval

## Next Steps Timeline

1. Complete ethical approval process
2. Finalize data collection 
3. Reading week (recharge batteries)
4. Begin data preprocessing after reading week
5. Start analysis phase all joined up with preparing the submission
