# Overview of Lab 02

## Please sit in your Personal Tutor Groups and in your Lab Groups.

-   Students who missed last week or are ungrouped - identify yourself
    and stay nearby.
-   If you are 'grouped' - please open the Miro Board and complete a
    group form Members - Full names - Topic - Methods - Working style

## Main Lab Activities

-   Follow the Worksheet for Literature Searching Tips, resources and
    exercises - this can be productive work towards BOTH your
    Personality Essay AND your Critical Proposal/Mini-Dissertation.
    Don't waste the time.
-   (Re-)Familiarise yourself with the idea of Effect Sizes and see if
    you can find one relevant to either `academic success` or your
    research topic
-   The Lab Tutor will be circulating and looking at work `on screen` to
    see how you are doing. Ask for any help you need.

## Module Milestones (by end of this week)

-   I'm in my group and we have a plan
-   I've got a rough idea of the Topic of my Mini-Dissertation
-   If after today, I sit down and read, or jot down ideas, whether for
    Essay or MD - it's useful productive work
