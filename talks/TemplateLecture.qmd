> The tidyverse provides an effective and efficient pathway for
> undergraduate students at all levels and majors to gain computational
> skills and thinking needed throughout the data science cycle.

# principles of the tidyverse

## tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   meta R package that loads eight core packages when invoked and also
    bundles numerous other packages upon installation
-   tidyverse packages share a design philosophy, common grammar, and
    data structures

## setup

**Data:** Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, a
peer-to-peer lending platform available in the **openintro** package,
with a few modifications.

## start with a data frame

## tidy data

1.  Each variable forms a column
2.  Each observation forms a row
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

## task: calculate a summary statistic

::: highlight
Calculate the mean loan amount.
:::

-   More verbose
-   But also more expressive and extensible

## the tidyverse approach

::: incremental
-   tidyverse functions take a `data` argument that allows them to
    localize computations inside the specified data frame

-   does not muddy the concept of what is in the current environment:
    variables always accessed from within in a data frame without the
    use of an additional function (like `with()`) or quotation marks,
    never as a vector
:::

# teaching with the tidyverse

## task: grouped summary

::: highlight
Based on the applicants' home ownership status, compute the average loan
amount and the number of applicants. Display the results in descending
order of average loan amount.
:::

## break it down I

::: {.column width="40%"}
Based on the applicants' home ownership status, compute the average loan
amount and the number of applicants. Display the results in descending
order of average loan amount.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Based on the applicants' home ownership status, compute the average loan
amount and the number of applicants. Display the results in descending
order of average loan amount.

## pedagogical strengths of the tidyverse

![](images/table1.png){fig-alt="Table 1 from paper: Consistency: Syntax, function interfaces, argument names and orders follow patterns; Mixability: Ability to use base and other functions within tidyverse syntax; Scalability: Unified approach to data wrangling and visualization works for datasets of a wide range of types and sizes; User-centered design: Function interfaces designed with users in mind; Readability: Interfaces that are designed to produce readable code; Community: Large, active, welcoming community of users and resources; Transferability: Data manipulation verbs inherit from SQL’s query syntax."

> We are all converts to the tidyverse and have made a conscious choice
> to use it in our research and our teaching. We each learned R without
> the tidyverse and have all spent quite a few years teaching without it
> at a variety of levels from undergraduate introductory statistics
> courses to graduate statistical computing courses. This paper is a
> synthesis of the reasons supporting our tidyverse choice, along with
> benefits and challenges associated with teaching statistics with the
> tidyverse.
