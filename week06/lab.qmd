## Exciting progress so far!

You've identified an exciting area of research and critically evaluated
a relevant paper.

Time to put all that hard work and careful thought into practice.

Between now and the end of term, you will build and obtain ethical
approval for your studies.

We are all in the process of marking Critical Proposals, and we are
seeing some wonderful application of the topics and concepts raised in
the module so far.

Some of you are making impressive claims about what you are going to do.
Fantastic!

## Don't push too hard, yet!

Please remember, this is supposed to be a modest size project, with
focus on following the steps from initial idea, critique, development,
Ethics, data collection and preparation, analysis and write-up.

We don't want any single step to be too daunting or labour-intensive. We
want you to enjoy the process as much as possible, and think carefully
about each step.

## The Mini-Dissertation 'rules'

-   Your ultimate individually written up Mini-Dissertation project MUST
    conform to the following definitive rules:
-   2x2 ANOVA design with 2 categorical IVs (each with 2 levels) and a
    single continuous DV
-   You must obtain ethical approval and prove individual involvement in
    the process of application
-   You must make a sample size estimation / Power calculation
-   You must collect data online and individually contribute to group
    data collection efforts

## Your Mini-Dissertation final submission must comprise:

### Submission Requirements

-   a 2500 word APA7 empirical paper with a critical reflection and
    complete reference list

-   Open Data - a single, cleaned, clearly-labelled data set in Excel
    format

-   Open Materials - a complete, replication-ready materials document
    detailing materials relevant to your submission
