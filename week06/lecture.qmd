## Week 6, Let's go!

-   Social Psychology Essay Tutorial this week
-   Have you done your reading and prepared?
-   A word on attendance and independent study

# Any Questions?

## The Weeks ahead

Every group needs to apply for (and receive) ethical approval prior to
the Winter Break. - Review the Ethics Page on the VLE - The same process
you will use next year - 1 application per group - pre-approved by Lab
Tutors - Planning is required and turnaround is 1 week - We deep dive
ethics next week (week 7) - but review the materials in advance

# It's time to get practical

## 'Operationalisation' of variables

Operationalisation of variables requires a consideration of the
reliability and validity of the method of operationalisation.

Operationalisation of variables also requires specification of the scale
of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.

Finally, operationalisation of variables can also specify details of the
measurement procedure.

See Howitt and Cramer Chapter 3.3 (Box Research Example - Condon & Crano
1988)

## Attitude similarity and interpersonal attraction

## Their DV (consider pros and cons)

This person would like (dislike) me

This person would like (dislike) working with me in an experiment

## The Student Room (question)

## The Student Room (answer 2)

## Of great importance that you reflect on this for your MD too

How have you [defined]{.underline} your variables of interest?

-   IVs and DVs

How have you [measured or categorised]{.underline} your variables of
interest?

-   e.g. Social Media use

-   Gender

-   Frequency or low/high extraversion

## **The research process**

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
-   Develop research aims 
-   Specify research questions/hypotheses related to these aims
-   Identify relevant constructs and concepts 
-   Translate constructs and concepts into variables (i.e., a logical
    set of characteristics/features)
-   Translate variables into measurements (i.e., the quantification of
    characteristics/features)
:::

## Quantitative Research

A systematic examination of relationships between variables

. . .

'Variables' are 'translated' from concepts, constructs or phenomena

. . .

Could be critiqued as 'reductionist'

## Types of Variable

Independent Variable

-   Experimental - The variable [I]{.shout} manipulate

-   Non-Experimental / Quasi-Experimental - Comparison between
    pre-existing groups

Dependent Variable

-   The variable you measure, that you propose to be influenced by a
    manpulation of the IVs
-   The \[D\]ata{.shout}

## Types of Measurement

Nominal/Categorical

-   Male/Female/...

-   Vegan / Vegetarian

-   Smoker/Non-Smoker

## Types of Measurement

Ordinal

Numbers representing a rank position in a group

Not representative of an actual definite number/score/value - without
information about the 'gap' between numbers

-   First, second, third

-   Tallest/Shortest

## Types of Measurement

Interval

Numbers represent equal units giving information about the 'gap' between
numbers

-   Temperature

-   Psychological Scales

## Types of Measurement

Ratio

Interval measurements with an absolute zero, of equal units,

-   Weight

-   Length

-   Time/Reaction time\*

## Median Splits

'Cutting' a distribution in half at the mid-point - with 50% on each
side of the cut

## Median Splits can be considered problematic

::: callout-warning
## Beware!

We often suggest a median split to dichotomise a continuous variable,
e.g. for the purposes of creating a 2 level IV.

It's a useful exercise in calculating a 'computed variable' in SPSS or
Jamovi

It is NOT best-practice usually. Why not?
:::

It is a key learning outcome that you are able to perform a standardised
analysis, specifically, the 2x2 ANOVA with any necessary assumption
checks and post-hocs + plots

## Think about this

## Operationalisation, measurement and definitions impact...

## Summary of part 1

You should think carefully about:

-   How you define your variables - this is probably a part of the
    introduction that students DON'T think about enough

-   How you measure or categorise your variables (IVs and DVs) - this is
    probably the single thing I look at first when peer-reviewing
    research!

-   How well your manipulation does what it claims to. Does you
    manipulation bring the thing it proposed to to life well?

# Running Experiments online or face to face

## Comparing Experiment Modalities

-   Online Surveys and Experiments
    -   Qualtrics - For surveys, stimulus presentation that don't
        require accurate timing
    -   Gorilla.sc - For 'experimental' tasks with complex stimulus \>
        presentation or that require response time measures or
        push-button \> responses etc.
-   Face-to-Face Experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Online Surveys and Experiments with Qualtrics

### Overview

-   A powerful tool for creating and distributing online surveys
-   Widely used in psychological research
-   We have an institutional licence and so it is FREE
-   No specialist support - has excellent online support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Qualtrics

### Accessibility

-   Reach a wide, diverse audience (if necessary)
-   Accessible by anyone with a phone or laptop etc

### Cost-Effective

-   Low 'cost' compared to face-to-face

### Data Management

-   Automated data collection, scoring and storage
-   Relatively easy to analyze and export data - but not always simple

### Customization

-   Highly customizable surveys and experiments (video, photos, audio,
    vignettes)
-   Supports various question types and logic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Qualtrics

### Limited Human Interaction

-   Lack of personal interaction can affect responses
-   You put a huge amount of trust in the participant
-   Not always easy to manage ethical challenges properly

### Technical Issues

-   Dependence on internet connectivity and user tech skills
-   An error in the build and you are in trouble \####

## Cons of Qualtrics (continued)

### Response Authenticity

-   Higher risk of dishonest or inattentive responses (maybe?)\

#### Sampling Bias

-   Potential for non-representative samples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to experiments using Gorilla.sc

### Gorilla.sc: highly controlled online Psychological Research

-   Facilitates creation, deployment, and analysis of experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Features of Gorilla.sc

### User-Friendly Interface

-   Intuitive design for researchers of all levels
-   Drag-and-drop experiment builder

### Requires 'tokens' to run

-   You will need to apply for 'tokens' to apply for ethics, and to run
    the study.
-   There is usually a limited supply as there is a cost associated with
    this.

### Versatile Experiment Design

-   Supports a wide range of experimental paradigms
-   Customizable to suit various research needs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experiment Creation with Gorilla.sc

### Building Blocks

### Analytical Tools

-   Built-in tools for basic data analysis
-   Export data for advanced analysis in other software e.g. SPSS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Collaboration and Sharing

### Team Collaboration

-   Share experiments and data with team members
-   Collaborate on experiment design and analysis

### Participant Recruitment

-   Still needs to be managed via sources outside of Gorilla

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gorilla.sc in Psychological Research

### Broad Application

-   Suitable for cognitive, social, and clinical psychology
-   Ideal for remote and large-scale studies

### Impact on Mini-Dissertations

-   Increases the reach of psychological studies requiring complex
    stimulus or timing
-   Not easy to get up and running with this tool
-   No specialist support - has excellent templates and online support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Face-to-Face Experiments

### Overview

-   Traditional method of conducting experiments
-   Involves direct interaction with participants

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Face-to-Face Experiments

### Enhanced Interaction

-   Direct human interaction enriches data quality

### Controlled Environment

-   Better control over experimental conditions

### Immediate Feedback

-   Opportunity for immediate clarification and feedback

### Participant Authenticity

-   Lower risk of false responses (maybe?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Face-to-Face Experiments

### Higher Costs

-   Greater resource and time investment (maybe?)

### Limited Reach

-   Restricted to participants' geographical location

### Time-Consuming

-   Scheduling and conducting sessions takes time

### Potential Biases

-   Risk of experimenter or social desirability biases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

### Choosing the Right Method

-   Depends on research goals, resources, and target population
-   Both methods offer unique advantages and challenges

### Tailoring to Research Needs

-   Consider the nature of your study and participant accessibility
-   Balance between quality, 'cost', and reach

------------------------------------------------------------------------
