Focused on understanding individuals’ subjective experiences and perspectives regarding specific situations.\n\nThe core of this approach lies in comprehending how people perceive and make sense of events, rather than examining the external events themselves. It demands ‘double hermeneutics’\n\nMethodology:\n\nInvolves detailed, reflective examinations of participants’ lived experiences.\nTypically uses small, purposively selected samples to provide in-depth insights.\nData is usually collected through semi-structured interviews or personal diaries."
