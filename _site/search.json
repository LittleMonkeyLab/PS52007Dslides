It is crucial to understand how ageing may impact autistic people due to both the increasing awareness of middle-age and later life for autistic people and the known changes that occur with ageing generally. Changes in cognitive abilities in particular are important as decline in cognition is associated with reduced independence and increased risk of dementia. In this seminar the speakers will present data on subjective and objective measures of cognitive abilities among autistic adults. They will discuss similarities and differences between findings, and comment on what these results mean for future research."

If not, how are we explain why so many people believe in ghosts with many of them claiming to have personally had a ghostly encounter? This talk attempts to answer these questions by considering a number of psychological factors that may lead someone to reach for a supernatural explanation when in fact a natural explanation would suffice.\nProfessor Chris French is the Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Patron of the British Humanist Association. He has published over 150 articles and chapters covering a wide range of topics. His main current area of research is the psychology of paranormal beliefs and anomalous experiences. He frequently appears on radio and television casting a sceptical eye over paranormal claims. His most recent book is Anomalistic Psychology: Exploring Paranormal Belief and Experience. Christopher French | Goldsmiths, University of London"
