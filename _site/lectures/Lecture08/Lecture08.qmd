# Overview

-   W10 Cognitive Essay Tutorial
-   Strike day 3/3 - 30th (Wed)
-   Labs - Ongoing task development and Ethics applications

## Who'd like to do some free-style Psychometrics?

Hands up for "Yes"

(in which case I'll re-record the lecture)

::: question
[**Will involve participation**]{.question}
:::

We can run this in-class exercise and if you want, I'll apply for ethics
to do the thing properly over the coming weeks. Could be publishable.

## Here's an idea...

A psychological measure of

. . .

X

## If you are up for it, we can start the first two steps

1.  [Articulate the construct and the context]{.takeaway}

2.  [Assemble items and decide on response format]{.takeaway}

3.  Data collection

4.  Assess Psychometric properties

## Or let's just do the lecture...

Your call!

## Psychometrics - Not as boring as you might think...

Psychological 'constructs' are tricky to pin down

May differ from 'naive' understanding

-   Consider 'Intelligence' and 'Empathy'

-   What about Personality?

## Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI)

@span2002

An incredibly valuable resource and a lovely way in to new topic areas!

## The challenge of measurement

::: incremental
-   To do it requires a clear understanding of the concept in question
-   You need technical skills and some friends
-   You need to be creative and thoughtful
-   It's research in itself, OR, a step required to do novel research!
-   Fascinating concepts *when seen in practice!*
:::

## 4 key steps to scale construction

::: incremental
1.  Articulate the construct and the context

2.  Assemble items and decide on response format

3.  Data collection

4.  Assess Psychometric properties
:::

## 1. Articulate the construct and the context

What are we measuring and how do we conceptualise it?

In what context is the construct displayed?

Is it 'unitary' or 'multidimensional'?

## 1.b Dimensionality (or Factors, Sub-scales, Facets)

![](images/paste-D1544C5F.png)

## 2a. Assemble items

Either write items or 'find' items.

::: incremental
-   e.g. The lexical approach to personality

-   or the Delphi Technique (Expert Opinions e.g. Clinicians)

-   Previous scales or items (other research

-   Talk to the target population/observation
:::

## 2b. Response format

There are options

::: incremental
-   **Likert Scales** (To what extent do you agree with SD - NAND -SA)

-   **Rating Scale** (On a scale of 1-7 how x are you?)

-   **Forced Choice** (a - Modesty doesn't become me. b - I am
    essentially a modest person)

-   **Semantic differential** (Healthy ------ Unhealthy)
:::

## 2.c Response choices

::: incremental
-   **Options** (True False, 7 point)

-   **Labels/anchors** (What is the midpoint?)

-   **Mid-points** (4 item or 5, Don't know, N/A, No opinion)

-   **Consistency of response across items**
:::

## Likert Scales (1) (Lick-ert) and Likert-type rating scales (2&3)

## ![](images/paste-AEDC3AA8.png)There are other scale types!

## **BRUSO Model of Writing Effective Questionnaire Items**

An acronym that stands for "Brief," "Relevant," "Unambiguous,"
"Specific," and "Objective,"

## "Stress" Simple, huh?

[The **Social Readjustment Rating Scale (**Holmes and Rahe, 1967) is a
self-report questionnaire on which people identify stressful events that
they have experienced in the past year and assigns points for each one
depending on its severity. For example, a man who has been divorced (73
points), changed jobs (36 points), and had a change in sleeping habits
(16 points) in the past year would have a total score of 125.]{.smaller}

. . .

[The **Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale** (Delongis et al., 1982)is
similar but focuses on everyday stressors like misplacing things and
being concerned about one's weight.]{.smaller}

. . .

[The **Perceived Stress Scale** (Cohen et al., 1994)is another
self-report measure that focuses on people's feelings of stress (e.g.,
"How often have you felt nervous and stressed?").]{.smaller}

. . .

[Researchers have also operationally defined stress in terms of several
physiological variables including blood pressure and levels of the
stress hormone cortisol.]{.smaller}

## Factor Analysis

## Would you like to have a go?

If you would like to, how about we develop a scale of our own.

Everyone who wants to have a go, come to the front.

## Glossary (Validity & Reliability) {.scrollable}

**Discriminant validity**

:   the relationship between some traits that should have weak or no
    relationship

**Face validity**

:   Does the scale appear to be measuring the variable? to researcher
    AND participant! e.g. Psychopathy at work scales. Cannot be TOO
    'criminal' or 'deviant'

**Content validity**

:   Do the items on the scale represent the various (and full) aspects
    of the variable being measured?

**Construct validity**

:   Does the scale actually measure the intended variable?

**Concurrent validity**

:   Does the scale relate to a relevant outcome or behavior that was
    measured at the same time?

**Predictive validity**

:   Does the scale relate to a relevant outcome or behavior that occurs
    in the future, after the scale is completed?

**Convergent validity**

:   the relationship between traits that are similar to (but not
    identical to) the trait being measured

**Criterion validity**

:   the relationship between some measure and some real-world outcome

**Discriminant validity**

:   the relationship between some traits that should have weak or no
    relationship

**Inter-rater reliability**

:   Inter-rater reliability agreement demonstrates consistent results
    between different examiners.

**Test-retest reliability**

:   reliability between tests conducted over short periods of time.

**Split-half reliability**

:   the correlation between to halves of the same proposed measure.
    Doing this for all the possible halves and averaging the result it
    Cohen's Alpha!
