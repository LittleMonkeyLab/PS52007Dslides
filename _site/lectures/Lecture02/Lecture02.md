# Insert Induction Week Poll insights here

# Did you break out the popcorn for the 'Prelude'?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ![](images/paste-720BC307.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Did any of you enjoy my movie recommendations?

Did you pick up on the theme?

I'd actually already kinda introduced it...

# from last week

## A confession

::: incremental
-   I didn't make that article 'I' wrote terribly obvious
-   for a reason
-   it felt a bit weird
-   I didn't write it
-   But there isn't really anything stopping me claiming so...
-   [Or is there?]{.shout}
:::

## A conundrum

I'm going to be fiercely recommending the use of AI tomorrow.

And ALSO warning you against its use elsewhere

huh?

## CHIP topics

I want to briefly draw your attention to the third (final) piece of
coursework for this module, the so-called 'CHIP Learning Log'

The earlier we flag topics and introduce little glimmers of content, the
easier that will be.

1 - What is Science? An amazing opportunity to consider this
[while]{.underline} you do your Mini-Dissertation

(A more reliable overview from Professor Ed Diener here) [**Open
Educational Resource**]{.underline}

Diener, E. (2022). Why science?. In R. Biswas-Diener & E. Diener (Eds),
*Noba textbook series: Psychology.* Champaign, IL: DEF publishers.
<http://noba.to/qu4abpzy>

2 - Artificial Intelligence - Promise or Peril?

## CHIP topic approval process

Anyone can suggest a topic, by identifying where it sprang to mind.

\# people need to approve it by confirming it is relevant, with a brief
rationale.

The more you engage, the more topics you get to choose from.

::: incremental
-   A concept or debate within Psychology
-   A historical issue or controversy
-   A methodology or approach and its promises or limitations
-   A distinctive or divisive topic
-   A modern innovation or applied challenge

## A psychologist? A scientist?

![](images/paste-DE336E79.png)

# Prize for guessing my favourite Psychologist

## Scientists base their 'claims' on EVIDENCE

![](images/paste-F158EEA8.png)

## Evidence quality = claim quality!

![](images/paste-BD7BCD67.png)

## It starts with a hypothesis

![](images/paste-D3D307F4.png)

## recap on hypotheses

![](images/paste-0E0430B8.png)

## The research process

![](images/paste-B4426E76.png)

## The simplicity of an experiment

![](images/paste-3D25B713.png)

## Operationalisation

![](images/paste-A9D3934A.png)

## The challenge of operationalisation

![](images/paste-C6316887.png)

## A toy example

![](images/paste-D76E2D76.png)

## Extraneous variables

![](images/paste-4B088F3A.png)

## Usually...

![](images/paste-5770750E.png)

## but occasionally...

you hear of 'confounds' or ['confounding variables']{.shout}

A confounding variable is an extraneous variable that [systematically
varies]{.underline} with one of your independent variables. These are
rare, but nothing can save the experiment.

![](images/paste-B5DC6F1B.png)

## An impossible interpretation

![](images/paste-755BCA67.png)

## Manipulations almost always introduce potential confounds

![](images/paste-EF9EB1AF.png)

## Experimental skill + careful thought + piloting + randomness!

![](images/paste-1931EC21.png)

## The importance of operationalising your variables well

![](images/paste-9B52240F.png)

## Reading along

I highly recommend reading along with the general topics we cover in the
first few weeks.

Research Methods in Psychology by Dennis Howitt and Duncan Cramer is
excellent. Chapter 2 in that book (right at the top of the module
reading list and
[here](https://www.vlebooks.com/Product/Index/896220?page=0)) deals with
Hypotheses and aims of research, essentially what we cover this week,
and Chapter 1 deals with the basics and golden rules of research design
and designing good experiments.

# Lab preview

## On Tuesday

We will be working on:

-   How to do a literature search like a pro (based on your newly chosen
    topic!)

-   Some ideas for group working and time management over the year

-   Previewing your week 3 Personal Tutor meeting

**Activities and resources will be provided**

### Any Questions?
