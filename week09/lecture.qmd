## Situating ANOVA Within the GLM

## What is the General Linear Model (GLM)?

- **GLM** is a framework that describes a broad set of statistical models.
- Includes techniques like:
  - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
  - Multiple Regression
  - ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)
  - MANOVA (Multivariate ANOVA)
  
## What is the General Linear Model (GLM)?

- Unified by the equation:

$$
Y = X\beta + \epsilon
$$

## Visualizing the General Linear Model (GLM)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-glm-visual
#| fig-cap: "Graphical Representation of the General Linear Model with Intercept(5) and Slope(2)."
#| out-width: "100%"

library(ggplot2)

# Example data for GLM
set.seed(123)
x <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.5)
beta_0 <- 5  # Intercept
beta_1 <- 2  # Slope
epsilon <- rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 1)  # Random error
y <- beta_0 + beta_1 * x + epsilon  # GLM equation

data <- data.frame(x, y)

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +  # Observed data points
  geom_abline(intercept = beta_0, slope = beta_1, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +  # True line
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 1), expand = c(0, 0)) +  # Single-unit x-axis graduations
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(y) + 1, by = 1), expand = c(0, 0)) +  # Single-unit y-axis graduations
  labs(title = "Graph of GLM: Y = 5 + 2X + ε",

```



## Key Elements of the GLM Equation 1/2

1. **Outcome Variable** (*Y*):
   - The dependent variable being predicted or explained.
   - Usually continuous in both regression and ANOVA models.

2. **Predictors** (*X*):
   - Independent variables in regression (e.g., continuous variables).
   - Grouping variables in ANOVA (e.g., categorical variables).
   
## Key Elements of the GLM Equation 1/2

3. **Coefficients** (*β*):
   - Represent the estimated weights or effects of predictors (*X*) on the outcome (*Y*).

4. **Error Term** (*ε*):
   - Captures the variation in *Y* that is not explained by the predictors.
---

## ANOVA as a Special Case of GLM

- ANOVA compares means across groups by partitioning variance:
  - **Total Variance = Variance Between Groups + Variance Within Groups**
- In GLM terms:
  - **X**: Encodes group membership using dummy variables.
  - **β**: Represents group mean effects.
  - **ε**: Residual error capturing unexplained variance.

## Extending to Factorial Designs: Main Effects

- Factorial designs include multiple predictors (e.g., **A** and **B**).
- Each predictor contributes to the outcome variable (**Y**) through:
  - **Main Effects**:
    - Effect of **A** (e.g., differences across levels of factor A).
    - Effect of **B** (e.g., differences across levels of factor B).
  - **Residual Error**: Variation unexplained by predictors.

---

## Extending to Factorial Designs: Interaction Effects

- Interaction effects occur when the effect of one predictor (**A**) depends on the level of the other predictor (**B**).
- Combined model for a factorial design:
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_A + \beta_2 X_B + \beta_3 (X_A \times X_B) + \epsilon
$$
- Partitioned Variance in Factorial ANOVA:
  - Main effects of **A** and **B**.
  - Interaction effect (**A × B**).
  - Residual error.
## ANOVA vs. Multiple Regression

### How They Are Related

- **ANOVA**:
  - Focuses on group differences (categorical predictors).
  - Example: Comparing means of 3 groups.

- **Multiple Regression**:
  - Allows continuous and categorical predictors.
  - Example: Predicting an outcome using test scores and group membership.

- **Connection**:
  - ANOVA is a regression model with categorical predictors encoded as dummy variables.

---

## Example: One-Way ANOVA as Regression

- Regression model for a one-way ANOVA:

**Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ε**

### Components:
- **X₁, X₂**: Dummy variables for groups.
- **β₁**: Difference between group 1 and the reference group.
- **β₂**: Difference between group 2 and the reference group.

## Visualizing the Relationship

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-anova-regression
#| fig-cap: "ANOVA as regression: Group means represented by dummy variables."
#| out-width: "100%"

library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(
  Group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10),
  Score = c(rnorm(10, mean = 70), rnorm(10, mean = 80), rnorm(10, mean = 90))
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Score)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", color = "red", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "One-Way ANOVA: Group Means",
       x = "Group", y = "Score") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Key Takeaways

### GLM Framework

- ANOVA and Regression are special cases of GLM.
- Both share the same foundation:
- **Y = Xβ + ε**:
  - Represents the General Linear Model (GLM).
  - \(Y\): Outcome variable (dependent variable).
  - \(X\): Predictors (independent variables).
  - \(β\): Coefficients for predictors.
  - \(ε\): Residual error term.

### Practical Differences

- ANOVA emphasizes group comparisons.
- Regression allows for both continuous and categorical predictors.

## Recap on Factorial Designs

## What Are Factorial Designs?

- Factorial designs involve multiple independent variables (IVs).
- Common in psychology research for testing complex interactions.
- Goal: To interpret **main effects** and **interactions**.

---

## Why Focus on 2x2 Designs this year?

- Simplest factorial design with:
  - 2 Independent Variables (IVs).
  - Each IV has 2 levels.
- Patterns in data can show:
  - Main Effects: Influence of each IV independently.
  - Interactions: Combined influence of IVs.

## Exploring Main Effects and Interactions

## Interpreting Main Effects

- Main effects represent the **consistent influence** of an IV.
- Example: **Coffee and wakefulness**:
  - More coffee = Higher alertness, regardless of location.

## Interaction Effects

- Interaction occurs when one IV’s effect depends on the level of another.
- Example: Coffee may affect wakefulness differently **in the morning** vs. **at night**.

## Best Practices for Factorial Designs

- Keep designs **simple**: Fewer IVs and levels make interpretation easier.
- Ensure **sufficient data** for all combinations of IV levels.
- Always visualize data before analysis to understand patterns.

---

## Summary

- **2x2 designs** are foundational in understanding factorial experiments.
- Interactions complicate main effects but reveal critical relationships.
- Use clear visualizations to enhance interpretation.
