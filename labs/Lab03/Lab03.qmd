## Interlibrary loan

If you can't get access to a paper that you think is crucial, consider
an interlibrary loan.

<https://www.gold.ac.uk/library/using/finding-resources/inter-library-loans/>

But there is no reason access to a single paper ought to slow you down.

## I've already mentioned

Zotero for managing your reading and creating references in APA7 format
