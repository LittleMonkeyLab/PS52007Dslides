## Think about the rest of your coursework

Try to anticipate when you will have busy times in the year and plan ahead

Do you have any personal obligations that will affect your availability?

## Think about your average week

When will you do your independent study?

When will you meet as a group?

What will you do if you miss class due to illness?

## Your first MD Personal Tutor Session is next week

You will need to present your general topic area, and any thoughts around how you are going to do the research.

Your personal tutor will be able to help you think about the realities of doing the work, but signalling the general area and type of research you want to do is most useful.

::: incremental
-   How will you do this most effectively?
-   What visual aids will you use?
-   Will you identify references?
-   Will you plan or prepare? You've got 50 minutes for all your groups...

## Personal Tutor management

Your Personal Tutor will be a HUGE help this year. Make sure they get the best information possible right at the start.

Do you think it might be a good idea to work as an entire Personal Tutor group and put something together to help your PT manage potential information overload?

::: incremental
-   A document with group name, topic and team members?
-   Maybe a shared folder with some illustrative papers?
-   What about a brief powerpoint with 1 slide per group that your PT can use moving forwards?

## Over to you!
