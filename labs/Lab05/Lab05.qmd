## I got the, I got the power!

The formal definition of a p value is the probability of observing a
result at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null
hypothesis is true (e.g. Cohen, 1994).

This means, and assuming we have a crystal ball to know the 'truth' of
whether there is an effect of our manipulation..

-   a small p value indicates the results are surprising if the null
    hypothesis IS true

-   a large p value indicates the results are not very surprising if the
    null IS true.

## 2x2 factorial ANOVA Power analysis

In a 2x2 design, there are three effects to compare:

-   the main effect of IV1,

-   the main effect of IV2,

-   and the interaction between IV1 and IV2.

## Look after the little effect first

There are three comparisons to make here and it is unlikely you would
expect the same effect size for all three comparisons, meaning you must
ensure all three effects are sufficiently powered. This just means that
your sample size will be sufficient to detect the weakest effect size of
the three.

You might expect the effect size (or difference) for IV1 to be a lot
larger than the effect size (or difference) for IV2, for example.

This means you would have to ensure the smallest effect is sufficiently
powered, in the above example, the IV2 effect size would drive the
sample size calculation.

if the smallest effect is covered, by virtue of the fact power exists
along a curve - then the larger effects would have sufficient power!
