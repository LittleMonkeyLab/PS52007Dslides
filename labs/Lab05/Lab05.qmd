## I got the, I got the power!

The formal definition of a p value is the probability of observing a
result at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null
hypothesis is true (e.g. Cohen, 1994).

> sciences (2nd ed.). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. I wouldn't bother.

## What?

This means, and assuming we have a crystal ball to know the 'truth' of
whether there is an effect of our manipulation..

-   a small p value indicates the results are surprising if the null
    hypothesis [IS]{.underline} true

-   a large p value indicates the results are not very surprising if the
    null [IS]{.underline} true.

## 2x2 factorial ANOVA Power analysis

In a 2x2 design, there are three effects to compare:

-   the main effect of IV1,

-   the main effect of IV2,

-   and the interaction between IV1 and IV2.

## Look after the little effect first

There are three comparisons to make here and it is unlikely you would
expect the same effect size for all three comparisons, meaning you must
ensure all three effects are sufficiently powered by a single
experimental design. This just means that your sample size will need to
be sufficient to detect the [weakest]{.underline} effect size of the
three.

You might expect the effect size (or difference) for IV1 to be a lot
larger than the effect size (or difference) for IV2, for example.

This means you would have to ensure the smallest effect is sufficiently
powered, in the above example, the IV2 effect size would drive the
sample size calculation.

if the smallest effect is covered, by virtue of the fact power exists
along a curve - then the larger effects would have sufficient power!

## G\*Power guide

If you are running a design with 2 between participant IVs, use Slide 1

If you are running a mixed design, and want to explore the between Main
effect - slide 2

If you are running a mixed design, and want to explore the within Main
effect - slide 3

If you are running a mixed design, and want to explore the interaction
effect - slide 4

If you are running a design with 2 between participant IVs, use Slide 5

## G\*Power guide - Key info

The following slides give you the specifics of what you need to include
depending on the effect you are exploring. The only thing you need is
the effect size of interest.

This is usually gleaned from your target paper (or other literature).

You will need to examine each of your effect sizes in your groups and
cover the weakest with the the sample size, so the effect that requires
the largest sample size will give the group sample size.

If you cannot find an effect, you may use a 0.3 f effect size, but this
is to be used only when no alternative is available.
