# Getting clarity on your variables

## Individual mini-dissertations

Must conform to a 2x2 ANOVA with a single continuous DV

## Lab activities

Formalise your individual design

## Notation

We use a notation system to refer to these designs:

[[2x2 = Two-way ANOVA]{.underline}. There are two IVS, the first IV has
two levels, the second IV has 2 levels. There are a total of 4
conditions, 2x2 = 4.]{.smaller}

[[2x3 = Two-way ANOVA.]{.underline} There are two IVs, the first IV has
two levels, the second IV has three levels. There are a total of 6
conditions, 2x3 = 6]{.smaller}

[[4x4 = Two-way ANOVA.]{.underline} There are two IVs, the first IV has
4 levels, the second IV has 4 levels. There are a total of 16 condition,
4x4=16]{.smaller}

[[**2x3x2 = Three-way ANOVA**]{.underline}.There are a total of three
IVs. The first IV has 2 levels. The second IV has 3 levels. The third IV
has 2 levels. There are a total of 12 condition. 2x3x2 = 12.]{.smaller}

## 3 'flavours' of 2x2 ANOVA

**2bx2b** - Between-subjects/Factorial ANOVA

**2wx2w** - Within-subject/Repeated Measures ANOVA

**2bx2w** or **2wx2b** - Mixed ANOVA

You will be using one of these (all supported by SPSS Exercise 1 and 2)

JAMOVI is a reasonable alternative to SPSS (also supported in Exercise 1
and 2)

## The 3 effects possible in a 2x2 ANOVA

Main effect of IV1

Main effect of IV2

Interaction of IV1\*IV2

## therefore 8 possible 'outcomes' of a 2x2 ANOVA

-   no IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction
-   IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction
-   no IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   no IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction
-   no IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction

## graph key for following charts

-   1 = there was a main effect for IV1.
-   \~1 = there was **not** a main effect for IV1
-   2 = there was a main effect for IV2
-   \~2 = there was **not** a main effect of IV2
-   1x2 = there was an interaction
-   \~1x2 = there was **not** an interaction
