# Is Psychology a Science?

## The Ongoing Debate

-   **Positivism in Psychology**: Traditional view supporting
    quantitative methods, treating human behavior as stable, measurable
    facts.
-   **Qualitative Shift**: A focus on dynamic, ever-changing aspects of
    human behavior, challenging the idea of fixed patterns, and possibly
    facts!

## The Role of Qualitative Research

-   **Qualitative vs. Quantitative**: The debate isn't about the
    validity of quantification but the quality of its application in
    psychology.
-   Where is Psychology's non-stick frying pan? [@banyard2015]
-   **Advancing Scientific Debate**: Qualitative research is at the
    forefront of discussions about the nature of scientific inquiry in
    psychology.

# The Structure of Scientific Revolutions

![](images/Kuhn.png){width="500"}

[Kuhn -
Structure](https://folk.ntnu.no/krill/bioko-references/Kuhn%201962.pdf)

## Paradigm Shifts

-   **Thomas Kuhn's Theory**: Science progresses through paradigm shifts
    rather than linear accumulation of knowledge.

-   **Application in Psychology**: Shifts from behaviorism to cognitive
    psychology, and then to more integrated approaches.

## Implications for Psychological Research

-   **Changing Research Methods**: Embracing diverse methodologies
    reflecting evolving paradigms in psychology.
-   **Interdisciplinary Influence**: Incorporating insights from
    philosophy, sociology, and neuroscience into psychological research.

## Psychology as a 'Soft Science'

-   Psychology compared to pre-scientific stages of sciences
-   The debate over applying 'the scientific method' in psychology
-   The importance of being phenomenon-centered and problem-centered
-   Misalignment of methods with research questions

# Conclusion?

## Psychology and Science

-   **Dynamic and Evolving**: Psychology, like other sciences, undergoes
    paradigm shifts and methodological evolution.
-   **Beyond Traditional Boundaries**: The discipline is increasingly
    recognizing the value of qualitative, subjective, and diverse
    approaches to understanding the human mind and behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Karl Popper and Falsification

## The Principle of Falsification

-   **Karl Popper's Contribution**: Emphasized the importance of
    falsifiability in scientific theories.
-   **Falsification vs. Verification**: Popper argued that scientific
    theories can never be completely verified, but they can be
    falsified.
-   **Impact on Psychology**: Encourages rigorous testing of hypotheses
    and openness to disconfirming evidence in psychological research.

## Critiques and Legacy

-   **Practical Challenges**: Difficulties in applying falsification
    principle in complex fields like psychology.
-   **Enduring Influence**: Popper's ideas continue to influence
    scientific methodology and philosophical discussions in psychology.

# Epistemology

## Epistemology

-   **Definition**: The study of knowledge -- its nature, origin, and
    limits.
-   **Relevance to Psychology**: Helps in understanding how we acquire
    knowledge about human behavior and mental processes.
-   How do we know what we know, or get to know something new?

# Understanding the **Ideographic/Nomothetic** Divide

[![](images/Qual@2x.png)](https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/looking-back-war-words)

## Ideographic Approach

-   **Focus**: Emphasizes the unique aspects of individual cases or
    phenomena.
-   **Methodology**: Often uses qualitative methods, such as case
    studies, to explore complex, subjective experiences.
-   **Goal**: To understand the depth and complexity of individual
    experiences.

## Nomothetic Approach

-   **Focus**: Seeks to identify general laws and patterns that apply
    across multiple cases.
-   **Methodology**: Employs quantitative methods, like experiments and
    surveys, to gather data on larger populations.
-   **Goal**: To formulate generalizations and broad theories applicable
    to many.

# Implications in Psychological Research

## Balancing Perspectives

-   **Integrating Approaches**: Both ideographic and nomothetic methods
    offer valuable insights; combining them can lead to a more holistic
    understanding of psychological phenomena.
-   **Challenges in Quantitative Research**: The need to acknowledge and
    address the reflexive capacity of human beings and the meaningful
    nature of data from aggregated descriptions of behavior.
-   **Innovative Research Possibilities**: Opportunities for innovative
    research that addresses these challenges, respecting the
    particularities of individual cases within broader patterns.
-   [@robinson2012a]

# Why should we care about this question?

## The Esteem of Science

-   Science's high regard in society and academia
-   The assumption that the scientific method leads to reliable results
-   The challenge in defining 'scientific method' and its
    transferability

## Conclusion: Rethinking Scientific Method in Psychology

-   Recognizing the influence of subjective experiences on observation
-   Understanding the interplay between facts, theory, and conceptual
    frameworks
-   The challenge of applying a rigid scientific method to human
    behavior and experiences

## Abstract

-   Psychology's struggle with foundational concepts: mind and behavior
-   Lack of unified theoretical framework
-   Classification as a 'soft science'
-   Need for diverse methodologies and systematic integration
-   Galtonian nomothetic methodology's limitations
