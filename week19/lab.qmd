## Lab Activities: Document Structure and Editing

- Pre-submission checklist
- Editing strategies
- Structuring the document
- Critical review and refinement
- Discussion sections (Chapter 16)
- Creating effective figures and tables (Chapter 17)

## Discussion Section Structure

1. Restate each hypothesis and interpret results
2. Connect to literature: Matches and divergences
3. Acknowledge limitations
4. Suggest future directions
5. Provide a concise conclusion
6. Include comprehensive references

## Restating and Interpreting Hypotheses

**Key Points:**

- Briefly remind readers of each hypothesis
- Clearly state whether data supports or refutes it
- Cite supporting literature

::: {.callout-tip}
**Example:** "As predicted, participants in the divided attention group showed a significant decline in memory performance (Hypothesis 1). This aligns with findings from Smith and Jones (2020), who reported similar cognitive impairments under conditions of complex attentional requirement."
:::

## Connecting to Existing Literature

**Key Points:**

- Highlight agreements with previous research
- Explain divergences and unexpected results
- Discuss theoretical implications

::: {.callout-tip}
**Example:** "While the overall trend aligns with the stress-impairment hypothesis, the observed gender differences diverge from prior research. This could be due to the inclusion of a more diverse sample, as suggested by prior critiques (e.g., Doe, 2021)."
:::

## Acknowledging Limitations

**Key Points:**

- Address methodological issues 
- Try to find better points than sample size or gender split
- Discuss potential biases or effect size implications
- Design issues are more important than sample size
- Explain impact on interpretation

::: {.callout-tip}
**Example:** "One limitation of the study was the relatively small sample size, which may have reduced the statistical power of the analyses. Future research should aim to replicate these findings with a larger and more diverse cohort."
:::

## Suggesting Future Directions

**Key Points:**

- Build on your findings
- Introduce novel questions inspired by results
- Suggest practical applications

::: {.callout-tip}
**Example:** "Future research could explore the role of coping mechanisms in mitigating stress-induced cognitive decline. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed to examine the long-term impact of stress on cognitive functions across different age groups."
:::

## Writing a Strong Conclusion

**Key Points:**

- Summarize key takeaways
- Revisit the original research question
- Emphasize broader impact

::: {.callout-tip}
**Example:** "In conclusion, this study highlights the detrimental effects of stress on working memory, underscoring the importance of interventions to reduce stress in high-pressure environments. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of cognitive resilience."
:::

## Creating Effective Figures

**Key Requirements:**

- Number figures sequentially (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.)
- Include a clear title at the top
- Ensure all elements are readable
- Place key/legend within the graph
- Add explanatory notes (including p-values)

## Figure Design Best Practices

- Use colors sparingly and consistently
- Consider accessibility (patterns can be better than subtle colors)
- Use a modest color palette
- Ensure figures are readable when converted to PDF
- Follow APA style guidelines: [APA Figure Examples](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-figures)

## Pre-submission Checklist

**Document Structure:**

- Title page complete with required information
- Abstract within word limit
- All required sections present
- References properly formatted
- Appendices included if necessary

## Pre-submission Checklist: Content

**Content Quality:**

- Research question/hypothesis clearly stated
- Methods described with sufficient detail
- Results presented accurately with appropriate visuals
- Discussion interprets findings and acknowledges limitations
- Conclusion summarizes key findings and implications

## Pre-submission Checklist: Formatting

**Formatting:**

- Correct font and size
- Proper margins and spacing
- Anonymous!
- Headings formatted consistently
- Figures and tables properly labeled
- In-text citations formatted correctly

## Editing Strategies: Global

**Global Editing (Content & Structure):**

- Read for overall argument coherence
- Check logical flow between sections
- Ensure each paragraph has a clear purpose
- Verify all claims are supported by evidence
- Confirm all research questions are addressed

## Editing Strategies: Local

**Local Editing (Language & Style):**

- Eliminate wordiness and redundancy
- Vary sentence structure
- Check for consistent tense use
- Ensure subject-verb agreement
- Replace vague terms with precise language

## Editing Approach

1. **First Pass:** Content and structure (big picture)
2. **Second Pass:** Paragraph-level organization
3. **Third Pass:** Sentence clarity and flow
4. **Fourth Pass:** Grammar, spelling, punctuation
5. **Final Pass:** Format, citations, references

## Critical Review Strategies

- Read your work aloud
- Use text-to-speech software
- Take a break before final review
- Have peers review your work
- Check against assessment criteria
- Use the "reverse outline" technique

## Reverse Outline Technique

1. Read your completed draft
2. For each paragraph, write 1-2 sentences describing what it does
3. Check whether paragraphs:
   - Serve a clear purpose
   - Follow a logical sequence
   - Contain relevant information
4. Reorganize as needed

## Nobody ever bothers to do this!

**Peer review:**

1. Swap seats and look at something your neighbour has written (do not email it!)
2. Review it using the checklist provided
3. Identify at least:
   - Two strengths
   - Two areas for improvement
   - One suggestion for clearer structure or communication

## Q&A and Discussion

- What aspects of document structure do you find most challenging?
- What editing strategies have worked well for you?
- How do you approach creating effective figures?
- What questions do you have about the discussion section?
