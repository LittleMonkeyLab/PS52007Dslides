## Overview

- Scientific communication: Why it matters
- IMRAD structure for scientific communication
- Designing effective visual content
- Practice makes perfect: Tips for delivery
- Q&A strategies

## Why Scientific Communication Matters {.smaller}

- **Knowledge sharing**: Advancing collective understanding in your field
- **Peer validation**: Opening your work to feedback and critique
- **Impact**: Ensuring your research influences academia, policy, or practice
- **Career advancement**: Building your academic reputation
- **Public understanding**: Bridging the gap between scientific research and public knowledge

## Communication Formats

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Posters**

- Visual emphasis
- Interactive, one-on-one
- Stand-alone content
- Browse & engage format
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Presentations**

- Slide-based
- Structured narrative
- Visual + verbal balance
- Time-limited
:::

:::

## IMRAD: The Scientific Structure

::: {.incremental}
- **Introduction**: What question are you addressing? Why does it matter?
- **Methods**: How did you investigate the question?
- **Results**: What did you find?
- **Discussion**: What do your findings mean in context?
:::


## IMRAD for Project Presentations

- **Introduction**: Context of research problem, knowledge gap, significance
- **Methods**: Proposed experimental design, procedures, analysis techniques
- **Results**: For project presentations, focus on *predicted* results
  - What outcomes would support your hypothesis?
  - What alternative outcomes might occur?
- **Discussion**: Implications of expected findings, limitations, future directions

::: {.notes}
For student presentations, emphasize that since this is a project proposal, they should focus on predicted results rather than actual results.
:::

## Adapting IMRAD to Presentations {.smaller}

| Section | Purpose | Slide Approach |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Introduction** | Hook audience, establish relevance | Clear problem statement, compelling visuals |
| **Methods** | Build credibility, explain approach | Simplified flowcharts, key methodological points |
| **Results** | Share discoveries, highlight importance | Data visualization, animations to build complexity |
| **Discussion** | Extract meaning, implications | Connection to broader field, future directions |

## Visual Design Principles {background-color="#f3f3f3" .smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Simplicity**: One main idea per slide
- **Consistency**: Visual language, colors, fonts
- **Contrast**: Make important elements stand out
- **Hierarchy**: Guide viewer attention
- **White space**: Allow content to breathe
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## Slide Design: Do's and Don'ts {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**DO**

- Use high-quality visuals
- Maintain consistent design
- Limit text (6x6 rule)
- Use clear, readable fonts
- Create meaningful titles
- Incorporate intentional animations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**DON'T**

- Use low-resolution images
- Include excessive text
- Use multiple fonts/styles
- Over-animate slides
- Use distracting backgrounds
- Present complex raw data
:::
:::

## Data Visualization Best Practices {background-color="#f3f3f3"}

- Choose appropriate chart types for your data
- Simplify: Focus on the key message
- Use color intentionally and consistently
- Label directly when possible
- Consider accessibility in design choices
- Tell a story with your data

::: {.notes}
Remind participants that visualizations should support understanding, not demonstrate software skills.
:::

## Know Your Audience

::: {.incremental}
- **Expert audiences**: Technical depth, methods focus, current debates
- **Mixed audiences**: Clear definitions, broader context, varied examples
- **Public audiences**: Relatable metaphors, visual storytelling, clear relevance
:::

## Presentation Delivery {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Preparation**

- Practice full run-throughs
- Time yourself rigorously
- Prepare transitions
- Create speaker notes
- Test technology beforehand
- Have backup plans
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Delivery**

- Maintain eye contact
- Use purposeful movement
- Modulate your voice
- Use pauses effectively
- Acknowledge questions clearly
- Manage time vigilantly
:::
:::

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

::: {.incremental}
- Excessive information on slides
- Speaking to the screen, not the audience
- Monotone delivery or reading directly from slides
- Poor time management
- Neglecting to practice transitions
- Apologizing unnecessarily
:::

## Tips for Meeting Assessment Criteria {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Make Your Introduction Clear**

- Start with a compelling hook
- Clearly state your research question
- Explain why your topic matters

**Present Background Effectively**

- Connect information to your research
- Demonstrate knowledge of the field
- Establish the knowledge gap
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Articulate Aims & Hypotheses**

- Make hypotheses testable and specific
- Connect aims to background information
- Use visual cues to emphasize key points

**Methodology Presentation**

- Use flowcharts for complex methods
- Explain why methods are appropriate
- Focus on critical aspects only
:::
:::

## Tips for Meeting Assessment Criteria II {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Predicted Results**

- Use clear visualizations
- Show example data formats
- Present multiple possible outcomes

**Implications**

- Connect back to research question
- Discuss significance of each potential outcome
- Address limitations honestly
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Presentation Skills**

- Practice vocal variety and eye contact
- Develop smooth transitions between sections
- Prepare for questions thoroughly
- Time each section during rehearsals
- Create backup slides for complex questions
:::
:::

## Q&A Strategies

- Anticipate likely questions
- Listen carefully before responding
- Be concise in your answers
- "I don't know" is a valid response
- Connect questions to your main points
- Follow up with questioners afterwards

## Effective Scientific Posters

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Clear, concise title
- Logical flow (typically left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Graphics dominate (60-70% visual)
- Text is minimal and scannable
- Contact information and QR codes for supplementary materials
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Consider narrative structure to maintain engagement
- Use signposting to help audience follow your logic
- Plan visual breaks in longer presentations
- Consider handouts for complex information
