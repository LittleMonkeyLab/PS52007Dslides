## Inclusive Research

Inclusive research is a term that was coined in the early twenty first
century to embrace participatory and emancipatory approaches to research
with people with learning/intellectual disabilities (Walmsley 2001)

Inclusive research embraces participatory and emancipatory approaches to
research. Its characteristics are that it:\
· Is owned (not necessarily initiated) by lay people\
· Furthers the interests of lay people, researchers are on their side\
· Is collaborative\
· Enables lay people to exercise control over process and outcomes\
· Produces outputs that are accessible.\
(adapted from Walmsley and Johnson 2003)

## context

wider rights movement. Nothing about us without us (Aspis 2000), a
slogan of the disabled people's movement, has been applied to research
as well as other areas.

exclusivity not only touches but also contorts and diminishes all
aspects of psychological science.

## Notation

We use a notation system to refer to these designs:

2x2 = Two-way ANOVA. There are two IVS, the first IV has two levels, the
second IV has 2 levels. There are a total of 4 conditions, 2x2 = 4.

2x3 = Two-way ANOVA. There are two IVs, the first IV has two levels, the
second IV has three levels. There are a total of 6 conditions, 2x3 = 6

3x2 = Two-way ANOVA. There are two IVs, the first IV has three levels,
the second IV has two levels. There are a total of 6 conditions, 3x2=6.

4x4 = Two-way ANOVA. There are two IVs, the first IV has 4 levels, the
second IV has 4 levels. There are a total of 16 condition, 4x4=16

2x3x2 = Three-way ANOVA.There are a total of three IVs. The first IV has
2 levels. The second IV has 3 levels. The third IV has 2 levels. There
are a total of 12 condition. 2x3x2 = 12.

-   1 = there was a main effect for IV1.
-   \~1 = there was **not** a main effect for IV1
-   2 = there was a main effect for IV2
-   \~2 = there was **not** a main effect of IV2
-   1x2 = there was an interaction
-   \~1x2 = there was **not** an interaction
