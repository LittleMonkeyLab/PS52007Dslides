Behavioural and Neural Signatures of Visual Body (mis)perception

Thursday, 3 November 2022 at 16:00 -- 17:00 - RHB 300a

[Visual representation of the body is a key aspect of self-body image.
Its importance in our social life is proved by the unreasonable time and
effort we put on taking care of our physical appearance, including use
of plastic surgery, as well as by the severe mental disorders linked to
its disturbance, such as Eating Disorders.]{.smaller}

# Any Questions?

## In the first lecture I mentioned...

![](images/cooltext421879728700980.png)

## But what did I mean?

Your individual 'take' on Psychology?

The Psychology you need or want for the future?

A career path with hundreds of different routes?

[or is it more personal than that?]{.shout}

## Do you need a 'passion' in Psychology?

We (staff) talk about this sometimes.

Is it critical that you find a topic of interest to you?

Does it help? Does it hinder?

Is it possible to be a Psychologist without a personal stake?

## Around us a crisis is unfolding

![](images/paste-91273085.png)

## Psychology is grossly misunderstood

![](images/paste-20A00E59.png)

## Next week

The Replication Crisis and our ongoing response - Open Science

The practice of Psychology we encourage in you!

## Research & me-search

## Reflexivity

Reflexivity and the psychologist

Reflexivity generally refers to the examination of one's own beliefs,
judgments and practices during the research process and how these may
have influenced the research.

An integral part of the Qualitative 'tradition'

[@morawski2005]

## Inclusive Research

Inclusive research is a term that was coined in the early twenty first
century to embrace participatory and emancipatory approaches to research
with people with learning/intellectual disabilities (Walmsley 2001)

Inclusive research embraces [participatory]{.underline} and
[emancipatory]{.underline} approaches to research.

Its characteristics are that it:\
· Is owned (not necessarily initiated) by lay people\
· Furthers the interests of lay people, researchers are on their side\
· Is collaborative\
· Enables lay people to exercise control over process and outcomes\
· Produces outputs that are accessible.\

## context

Research situated within the wider rights movement.

#### "Nothing about us without us" (Aspis, 2000).

a slogan of the disabled people's movement, has been applied to research
as well as other areas.

"exclusivity not only touches but also contorts and diminishes all
aspects of psychological science" (Ledgerwood et al., 2022, p.2).

## Lab activities

Keep working!

Formalise your individual design

## More specific

## Notation

We use a notation system to refer to these designs:

[[2x2 = Two-way ANOVA]{.underline}. There are two IVS, the first IV has
two levels, the second IV has 2 levels. There are a total of 4
conditions, 2x2 = 4.]{.smaller}

[[2x3 = Two-way ANOVA.]{.underline} There are two IVs, the first IV has
two levels, the second IV has three levels. There are a total of 6
conditions, 2x3 = 6]{.smaller}

[[4x4 = Two-way ANOVA.]{.underline} There are two IVs, the first IV has
4 levels, the second IV has 4 levels. There are a total of 16 condition,
4x4=16]{.smaller}

[[**2x3x2 = Three-way ANOVA**]{.underline}.There are a total of three
IVs. The first IV has 2 levels. The second IV has 3 levels. The third IV
has 2 levels. There are a total of 12 condition. 2x3x2 = 12.]{.smaller}

## 3 'flavours' of 2x2 ANOVA

**2bx2b** - Between-subjects/Factorial ANOVA

**2wx2w** - Within-subject/Repeated Measures ANOVA

**2bx2w** or **2wx2b** - Mixed ANOVA

You will be using one of these (all supported by SPSS Exercise 1)

JAMOVI is a reasonable alternative to SPSS

## The 3 effects possible in a 2x2 ANOVA

Main effect of IV1

Main effect of IV2

Interaction of IV1\*IV2

## therefore 8 possible 'outcomes' of a 2x2 ANOVA

-   no IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction
-   IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction
-   no IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction
-   no IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction
-   no IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction

## graph key

-   1 = there was a main effect for IV1.
-   \~1 = there was **not** a main effect for IV1
-   2 = there was a main effect for IV2
-   \~2 = there was **not** a main effect of IV2
-   1x2 = there was an interaction
-   \~1x2 = there was **not** an interaction
