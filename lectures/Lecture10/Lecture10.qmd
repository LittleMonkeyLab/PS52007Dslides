-   If you are not on campus, you will need to engage with us remotely!
:::

## Please help out and confirm status

::: incremental
-   Lab Tutors will do a quick tour to get a brief status update from each group.

-   We will prioritise time with you all based on that.

-   Please raise any concerns you have, so that we can help.

-   OR if you need to drop-in online (Rail strikes)

## Next term

Next term is essentially split into two halves:

Each week, we will focus on a key skill or procedure, supplying useful resources and guidance, but leaving the rest of the lab session for independent work, advice and support from your Lab Tutor, or anything else you think would be helpful!

::: incremental
-   Weeks 10 -- 15 are geared towards data collection and data preparation

-   Weeks 16 -- 20 are geared towards analysis, writing up, and preparing your submission

## New on the VLE

**You can find these all on the VLE in the**

**'Mini-Dissertation resources' section of the VLE**

::: incremental
-   An APA 7^th^ Edition Mini-Dissertation template word document
-   An APA 7^th^ Edition Reference Cheat Sheet
-   Extended Mini-Dissertation Marking Criteria
-   2 x Example Mini-Dissertations
:::

## APA 7 Mini-Dissertation Template

Your Mini-Dissertations must conform to the correct format. Easy marks.

**We use APA 7^th^ Edition and in the style of a professional journal article manuscript submission.**

::: incremental
-   The word document template features all the major stylistic formatting you will need, with some helpful pointers throughout.
-   When you write your Mini-Dissertation, you just need to delete all the tips and put in your wonderfully crafted prose and results!
-   A common mistake is to deviate from the APA formatting. Please try not to do this! It counts.
:::

## **APA style will be the focus of Week 16.**

APA 7 Reference Cheat Sheet

::: incremental
-   A key part of APA 7^th^ Edition is reference format. **We will also cover this briefly in week 16**. 
-   We have already a number of other electronic resources that might help you ensure you follow the correct format, but in the first instance, this Cheat Sheet will be very handy.
:::

## Mini-Dissertation Extended Marking Criteria

Another resource we've given you today is an **extended Mini-Dissertation Marking Criteria**.

::: incremental
-   These are the criteria used by the markers and moderators to calibrate marks and ensure accuracy and consistency.
-   An abbreviated version will be attached to the feedback that you receive.
-   You will see that there are numerous categories, but each requires some consideration. Have a look over this when you get some time.
-   A screencast will be provided discussing this in more detail, overviewing submission requirements, and highlighting common pitfalls, and tips for the top!
:::

## Example Mini-Dissertations

Points to attend to:

::: incremental
-   2,500 words is NOT as long as you think
-   5 paragraphs (key points) in Intro and Discussion
-   Methods section wins marks!
-   [Both examples achieved firsts, but marks were 'left on the table']{.border}
:::

## Closing points on the Mini-Dissertation

::: incremental
-   The reflective account is a required part of the Mini-Dissertation
-   We may be asking for a 'contribution statement'
-   Your involvement in data collection AND participation is monitored next term
-   Open Materials and Open Data are key parts of the submission and are featured in the marking
-   But it's just a lab report. You've done 3 of those already.

# Have a great last week of term!
