# 'Operationalisation' of variables

Operationalisation of variables requires a consideration of the reliability and validity of the method of operationalisation.

Operationalisation of variables also requires specification of the scale of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.

Finally, operationalisation of variables can also specify details of the measurement procedure.

See Howitt and Cramer Chapter 3.3 (Box Research Example - Condon & Crano 1988)

## Attitude similarity and interpersonal attraction

## Their DV

This person would like(dislike) me

This person would like(dislike) working with me in an experiment

## Let's think about your forthcoming Personality essay

Two key concepts you'll be thinking about and reading around...

-   Intelligence

-   important life outcomes

## Hopefully, you will ask yourself...

How are these important and very tricky concepts

-   Defined

-   Measured

-   And brought to life!

## Of great importance that you reflect on this for your MD too

How have you [defined]{.underline} your variables of interest?

-   IVs and DVs

How have you [measured or categorised]{.underline} your variables of interest?

-   e.g. Social Media use

-   Gender

-   Frequency or low/high extraversion

## **The research process**

•Develop research aims 

•Specify research questions/hypotheses related to these aims

•Identify relevant constructs and concepts 

•Translate constructs and concepts into variables (i.e., a logical set of characteristics/features)

•Translate variables into measurements (i.e., the quantification of
characteristics/features)

## Quantitative Research

A systematic examination of relationships between variables

'Variables' are 'translated' concepts, constructs or phenomena

## Types of Variable

Independent

-   Experimental - The variable I manipulate

-   Non-Experimental - Comparison groups

Dependent

-   The variable you measure, that you propose to be influenced by a manpulation of the IVs

## Types of Measurement

Nominal/Categorical

-   Male/Female/...

-   Vegan, Vegetarian

-   Smoker/Non-Smoker

## Types of Measurement

Ordinal

Numbers representing a rank position in a group

Not representative of an actual definite number/score/value - without information about the 'gap' between numbers

-   First, second, third

-   Tallest/Shortest

## Types of Measurement

Interval

Numbers represent equal units giving information about the 'gap' between numbers

-   Temperature

-   Psychological Scales

## Types of Measurement

Ratio

Interval measurements with an absolute zero, of equal units,

-   Weight

-   Length

-   Time/Reaction time\*

## Dani's example:

• My [age]{.underline} is [33]{.shout} years.

• I [do not]{.shout} like [anchovies]{.underline}.

• My [chromosomal gender]{.underline} is [male]{.shout}.

• My [self-identified gender]{.underline} is [male]{.shout}\*

\*see footnote 2, page 14 Learning Statistics with Jamovi

## Median Splits

::: callout-warning
## Dangerzone!

We often suggest a median split to dichotomise a continuous variable, e.g. for the purposes of creating a 2 level IV.

It's a useful exercise in calculating a 'computed variable' in SPSS or Jamovi

It is NOT best-practice usually.
:::

It is a key learning outcome that you are able to perform a standardised set of analysis, specifically, the 2x2 ANOVA with any necessary assumption checks and post-hocs + plots

## Operationalisation, measurement and definitions impact...

## Summary

You should think carefully about:

-   How you define your variables

-   How you measure or categorise your variables

-   How well your manipulation does what it claims to
