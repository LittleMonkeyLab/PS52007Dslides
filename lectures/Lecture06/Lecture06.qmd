# Any Questions?

# 'Operationalisation' of variables

## Let's think about your forthcoming Personality essay

Two key concepts you'll be thinking about and reading around...

-   Intelligence

-   important life outcomes

## Hopefully, you will ask yourself...

How are these important and very tricky concepts

-   Defined

-   Measured

## Of great importance that you reflect on this for your MD too

How have you [defined]{.underline} your variables of interest?

-   IVs and DVs

How have you [measured or categorised]{.underline} your variables of interest?

-   e.g. Social Media use

-   Gender

-   Frequency or low/high extraversion

• My [self-identified gender]{.underline} is [male]{.shout}\*

It's a useful exercise in calculating a 'computed variable' in SPSS or Jamovi

It
:::

It is a key learning outcome that you are able to perform a standardised set of analysis, specifically, the 2x2 ANOVA with any necessary assumption checks and post-hocs + plots

## So...
