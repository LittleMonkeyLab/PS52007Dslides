# Overview of the CHIP Learning Log

## CHIP Learning Log - What's it all about?

::: callout
CHIP stands for Conceptual, Historical and Integrative Perspectives.
:::

. . .

As you become active psychological researchers - and over half way
through your undergraduate training in psychology - it is important to
consider the wider context of what you are doing.

## Learning log? huh?

::: callout
A Learning Log is a reflective account of your learning journey. It
requires reflection and meta-cognitive practice.
:::

. . .

By thinking about your personal learning journey, you take an objective
'outside' perspective on this important process. By doing so, it aids
meta-learning - or the process of 'learning to learn'.

. . .

> Whether you end up being a 'psychologist' or not, your degree is an
> important opportunity to demonstrate your ability to learn (knowledge
> AND skills)

## Assessment

::: smaller
Coursework is designed to allow you to engage with the 'big picture' of
your degree

Think about how these issues link into psychology as a discipline, and
how they relate to your own thoughts about what psychology is or should
be

Two essays of **max** 700 words each

Marks are awarded for reflection, evidence of learning and bring topics
together. Please see marking criteria for both essays.

Not a regurgitation of facts.

They are designed to be personal and reflective -- embrace this aspect!
:::

## Essay 1

Essay 1 is based on the content of ONE of the FOUR topics and should
adopt at least two of the following 6 'perspectives'.

::: fragment
STU - Your interests or experience as a student of psychology;
:::

::: fragment
TRN - Your role as a trainee psychologist;
:::

::: fragment
RES - A planned research project in or after your degree;
:::

::: fragment
HIS - The history of Psychology and related disciplines;
:::

::: fragment
PRA - Reporting on the Practice or Culture of Psychology;
:::

::: fragment
SCI - Assumptions about science and how it relates to psychology
:::

## Essay 1 tips

-   Ask a specific question -- and answer it.
-   Intro, body, conclusion structure.
-   Reflect on the topic and give your own opinion as to the answer!
-   Present a journey in your learning or appreciation of the topic
-   Ensure your answer is argued using examples
-   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do
    some strategic wider reading
-   Present and reference it well

## Essay 2 {.smaller}

::: smaller
Essay 2 should focus on at least one of the OTHER topics covered in the
course.

This answer should focus on a primary reading associated with the
lectures and then any further reading you have done (strongly
encouraged).

You must identify that primary reading explicitly in the essay itself.

You should not simply restate what the authors thought or found, but
rather briefly summarise the point that stimulated your interest in the
reading and use that as a springboard to discuss the topic or issue.

Think about your perspective on the issues.

What do you think about this debate or issue? We want to know!

And what do you think are interesting directions for psychologists to
take this debate or issue in the future?
:::

## Essay 2 tips

-   Explicitly identify a single initial reading and build upon that.
-   Discuss a debate or issue that you think is interesting or important
-   Give your own opinion and how this has developed or changed as a
    result of the lecture, the course more widely, and/or the reading.
-   Argue your opinion explicitly, own it and back it up with examples
-   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do
    some strategic wider reading
-   Present and reference it well

## Overlapping content

You can combine across different topics in Essay 2 (e.g., you could talk
about Evolution and Consciousness, or Inclusivity and Meta Learning),
and thinking about links between topics is strongly encouraged.

However, the material covered in Essay 2 must be different from Essay 1.
Students will be penalised for covering identical topics.

## Submission

::: takeaway
Deadline is 10am Friday 21st April -- Â±3 weeks after the end of term
:::

Both answers should be written in essay-style prose (e.g., with APA
references where you refer to sources) put in a single document and
submitted to the coursework submission page.

[Max 700 words per answer (references not included in word
count)]{.underline}

Remember that this only accounts for a smaller portion of the module
grade (15%). Should hopefully be an enjoyable way to reflect on issues
on the course you found interesting.

## Mini-Dissertation Reflective Account

Just a quick reminder about the [compulsory]{.underline} reflective
account at the end of the Mini-Dissertation.

If you do not supply this, your Mini-Dissertation is not complete and
this impacts the mark.

It is NOT an opportunity to gripe about group work, or to try to obtain
favourable marks.

It's another opportunity to reflect on your learning journey.
