# Induction Overview

## Welcome back and welcome to Research Methods!

## This year you become Scientists!

This year, in Research Methods, you will perform your first piece of
REAL psychological research

In groups, you will:

::: small
-   Identify an area of psychological research
-   Review and critique the literature in this area
-   Develop a testable hypothesis
-   Design a 2x2 ANOVA experiment unique to you (within your group
    study)
-   Obtain Ethical Approval for your experiment
-   Collect REAL data
-   Analyse these data
-   Write up the results in APA format
:::

## A full overview will be given in the first lecture!

Do not worry! It's going to be a great adventure!

## A 'warm up' for your Y3 Dissertation

The same 20-week timeline

The same skills and techniques you will need

Careful step-by-step guidance and support in the lab setting

Scaled-down experiments and write-ups

The security of working in a group

Tips and advice from world-class researchers

Opportunity to think carefully about your final year Dissertation, and
how to crush it!!

## Support and guidance

Gordon Wright (Module Coordinator and floating Enthusiast in Chief)

7 gobsmackingly amazing Lab Tutors

Your Personal Tutor and your PT group

AND EACH OTHER!!

This is a team-sport

## me

I will be in every Research Methods lecture and I have a Student Hour
from 3-4 every Monday, before we all go to the Design & Analysis
lecture. Yup! Me too!

Available at g.wright\@gold.ac.uk

I genuinely could not imagine anything I would rather do that this. I
love Research, and vehemently believe it is the #1 skill EVERYONE should
have... not just psychology students... EVERYONE!

## Module weighting and assessment

Research Methods is a core module with a 30 credit weighting

This means that in order to progress to Y3, you must pass all 3
assessment elements:

-   ::: takeaway
    -   Critical Proposal 1,800 words (15%)

    -   Mini-Dissertation 2,500 words (70%)

    -   CHIP Learning Log 2x700 words (15%)

## Module structure

1 x 1 hr Lecture per week (Monday)

1 x 2 hr Lab per week (Tuesday)

4 x Personal Tutor meetings across the year

Each week there will be a very brief 'Prelude' designed to introduce one
of the main topics of the week

Lecture (slides and recording)

Lab Activity

'Pulse' taken on entry

Lab Notebook with brief 'generative activities' and opportunities for
metacognitive reflection

Extras provided around skills or applications or just interesting
factoids

Extensive independent and group work in addition to timetabled
activities

NO EXAM

## Coursework

The coursework ALL require critical reflection and metacognitive
practice. This will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it
contributes to effective learning and your integration of the skills and
experience of doing this research exercise.

## Time management and teamwork

..will both be required.

I ask you to see both as an opportunity to develop these important
skills.

You will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers
and employability

It is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.

## Resources

We will be releasing a series of valuable resources to help you through
every step of the process

These will have value for your final year dissertation too.

Contribution.

Open Educational Resources.

## Prelude 1

We are starting off very easy. A short questionnaire to allow us to get
to know you a little better, which we will use to develop the first
lecture, and the course more generally.
