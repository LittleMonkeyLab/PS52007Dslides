## So why do people lie? @levine2010d

![](images/paste-D0937F91.png)

## It ain't that bad really!

Deception frequency is significantly correlated to neocortical volume
across species @byrne2004a.

. . .

Evolution selects for more and more effective strategies of achieving
social success (including deception, manipulation, alliance formation,
exploitation of the expertise of others, etc.)

. . .

And for the ability to learn and use such strategies.

. . .

Social success translates into reproductive success!

## Monkey Business see @shultz2022

. . .

\
Observations of non-human behaviour of the type led scientists to
suggest a positive relationship between brain size and social group
size.

. . .

\
A bigger brain seems to be found in more complex social environments.
But bigger brains are costly.

. . .

\
There has to be a benefit to carrying around this big brain.

## The dynamic social environment see @whiten2018

. . .\
The social world is very complex and the characters in this social world
are difficult to predict.

. . .\
We usually operate within a status hierarchy which predetermines our
opportunities. Think of our cheeky little monkey. What did he want?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Access to food
-   Access to shelter
-   Access to mates
-   Safety and Security of self and offspring
:::

[Navigating the hierarchy successfully requires cooperation and
competition.]{.takeaway}

## The Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis (@byrne2018)

The Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis posits that social demands
have driven the evolution of the cognitive facilities humans employ to
navigate their social domain.

'Machiavellian' strategies, such as deception, interpersonal
manipulation, cooperation, and alliance formation allow individuals to
achieve higher social and reproductive success.

. . .\

[Maybe it would help to be a bit more "Machiavellian"?]{.takeaway}

## But how can we possibly measure 'Lie Frequency'?

::: columns
::: column
Self- or other-report

Diary study (or similar)

Some kind of app?

Motion capture suits and TV cameras?

Experimental, lab-based research
:::

::: column
![](images/paste-5E12FEC5.png){width="30%"}
:::
:::

## Machiavellianism

. . .

Sensitive to social context, and will switch quickly between cooperation
and competition depending on utility

. . .

\
Endorse emotional manipulation and use emotional skills to ingratiate

. . .

\
Comprises a cynical view of human nature and interpersonal manipulation
tactics (perception of the world and behaviour)

## Narcissism

. . .

Vain, 'grandiose sense of self', with high levels of entitlement

. . .

\
The Narcissist is unique and special

. . .

\
Narcissists, as a result of being surrounded by 'mere mortals' may show
reduced empathy for others and disregard their goals or status

. . .

\
Narcissists maintain their grandiose sense of self by seeking out
praise, adoration, adulation and avoiding realistic feedback

Grandiose/Vulnerable distinction is starting to get hold.

## Psychopathy

. . .

Manifest disregard for other people - Low empathy, disruptive behaviours
verging on bullying or sadism, deception thought to be a central
feature.

. . .

\
Superficial charm and glibness. Erratic lifestyle factors and high
impulsivity. Extreme reward appetite and low fear of loss or punishment.
Often related to criminal activity.

. . .

\
Boldness, Meanness, Disinhibition is the 3 Factor structure suggested by
the Triarchic Model (Patrick 2010, onwards)

## Bonus prize - Sadism

. . .

As part of the Dark Tetrad, sadism is investigated in its subclinical
manifestation---***everyday sadism***.

. . .

\
When people enjoy watching violent movies or even playing violent games
as a social escape to manifest their sadistic traits it is referred to
as ***vicarious sadism***.

. . .

\
There is sometimes an alternative aspect called ***direct sadism***, but
it is actually far too rare to be useful in most studies.

. . .

\
In turn, higher scores in everyday sadism are associated with injuring
others verbally, physically, and/or psychologically, inspired by a
hedonic value of being cruel.

## So let's briefly think about the study

They 'operationalised' deception in the following way:

![](images/Gunderson.png)

## They measured 'duping delight'...

![](images/PANAS@2x.png)

## Does that satisfy you? 

Is that a good way to measure an emotional reaction?
