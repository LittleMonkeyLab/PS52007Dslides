abstract = {We investigated (N = 447) the relationship between the Dark Triad traits (i.e., psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism) and domain-general and domain-speciﬁc measures of deception. Psychopathy and Machiavellianism were linked to telling more lies, psychopathy was linked to telling lies for no reason, and Machiavellianism was linked to telling white lies. Narcissism, in contrast, was linked to lying for self-gain and self-reported skill at lying. The Dark Triad traits were linked to the use of various intersexual and intrasexual deception tactics but these differed as a function of the domain, the category of deception, and the particular tactic used. We found some evidence that sex differences in deception were partially a function of individual differences in the Dark Triad traits. Our results provide new details about the cheater strategies linked to the Dark Triad traits.},

abstract = {Research has documented substantial individual differences in the proclivity for honesty or dishonesty and that personality traits meaningfully account for variations in honesty–dishonesty. Research also shows important situational variation related to deception, as situations can motivate or discourage dishonest behaviors. The current experiment examines personality and situational influences on honesty–dishonesty in tandem, arguing that their effects may not be additive. Participants (N ¼ 114) engaged in an experimental task providing the opportunity to cheat for tangible gain. The situation varied to encourage or discourage cheating. Participants completed the HEXACO-100 and the Dark Triad of Personality scales. Both situational variation and personality dimensions predicted honesty–dishonesty, but the effects of personality were not uniform across situations. These results were also supported using public data from an independent, multilab sample (N ¼ 5,757). We outline how these results inform our understanding of deception, situational influences, and the role of disposition in honesty.}, }

abstract = {We propose a typology of lies that distinguishes six kinds of these in terms of beneﬁciary (self, Pareto, other) and motivation (protective vs beneﬁcial). We gathered data from a daily diary study (N = 81). Distinct individual diﬀerences were related to speciﬁc types of lies, showcasing the importance of distinguishing between types of lies. Low self-esteem, high anxiety, and high Machiavellianism involved frequent use of beneﬁcial lies. Conversely, protective lies were negatively related to Machiavellianism and positively to empathy. Self-oriented beneﬁcial lies were related positively to Machiavellianism in particular. Empathy was related to the use of otheroriented protective lies. These results give new insight into the processes that trigger lies and help to integrate and structure research on lying.}, }

abstract = {The present study (N = 462) examined the relationship between the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) and deception in domain-general and domain-speciﬁc contexts. As predicted, psychopathy and Machiavellianism were linked to the propensity to lie in different contexts, including mating and academic dishonesty. Psychopathy was related to experiencing more positive emotions associated with lying and Machiavellianism was associated with increased amount of cognitive effort associated with deception. Sex differences in deception were partially mediated by individual differences in the Dark Triad traits. Our ﬁndings have important implications for the interpersonal strategies employed by those high on the Dark Triad.},

abstract = {People deceive for different reasons, from avoiding interpersonal conflicts to preserving, protecting, and nurturing interpersonal relationships, and to obtaining social status and power. A growing body of research highlights the role of personality in both deception detection and production, with a particular focus on high Dark Triad (DT) traits (Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy), for their shared tendency to engage in unethical self-benefitting behaviors, despite negative consequences for others. The main goal of the current scoping review was to bring together the studies investigating self-reported and performance-based deception production and detection performances, as presented in individuals characterized by high DT traits and point out the possible contribution of DT to deception research. To do so, we identified the relevant studies documenting the similarities and discrepancies between the three personality traits and presented their results, based on the procedure used for deception assessment: subjective or objective measurements for production / detection. Then, we discussed possible explanatory mechanisms for inter-individual differences in lie detection / production and argue for the contribution of DT to deception research beyond the typical personality models, particularly for the antisocial character of deception.

abstract = {Human brain organization is built upon a more ancient adaptation, the large brain of simian primates: on average, monkeys and apes have brains twice as large as expected for mammals of their size, principally as a result of neocortical enlargement. Testing the adaptive benefit of this evolutionary specialization depends on finding an association between brain size and function in primates. However, most cognitive capacities have been assessed in only a restricted range of species under laboratory conditions. Deception of conspecifics in social circumstances is an exception, because a corpus of field data is available that encompasses all major lines of the primate radiation. We show that the use of deception within the primates is well predicted by the neocortical volume, when observer effort is controlled for; by contrast, neither the size of the rest of the brain nor the group size exert significant effects. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neocortical expansion has been driven by social challenges among the primates. Complex social manipulations such as deception are thought to be based upon rapid learning and extensive social knowledge; thus, learning in social contexts may be constrained by neocortical size.},

The theory is argued to account for wide swings in vulnerability to deception in different types of situations in and out of the lab. Three moderators are advanced to account for differential vulnerability to political misinformation and disinformation. Own belief congruity, social congruence, and message repetition are argued to combine to affect the probability that implausible and refutable false information is accepted as true.},
