abstract = {When time is limited, researchers may be faced with the choice of using an extremely brief measure of the Big-Five personality dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is oﬀered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.}, }

year = {2011},
abstract = {Brief measures of individual differences are growing in popularity. The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al., 2003) increases administration efficiency and maintains construct validity, but sacrifices some internal consistency when measuring the Big Five personality traits. In a survey of 360 college students, we attempted to replicate and extend the construct validity of the TIPI by relating it to sociosexuality and self-esteem. We replicated some of the most well documented Big Five correlations: Self-esteem was negatively correlated with neuroticism and positively with extraversion; sociosexuality was positively correlated with extraversion and negatively with agreeableness. Results suggest the TIPI measure is reasonably valid.}, }

abstract = {Three separate models have been proposed to describe the factor structure of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the past 20 years. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III, 1980) proposed 3 separate factors of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The DSM-III-R (1987) proposed a single factor. The DSM-IV (1994) described the disorder as having 2 factors: hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention. The following 2 studies employed confirmatory factor analysis to compare each of these …}, }
