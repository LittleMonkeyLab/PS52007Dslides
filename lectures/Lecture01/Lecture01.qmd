## But seriously...

::: incremental
-   Formerly worked in advertising industry for big agencies
-   Impulsively started a Psych degree in 2006 (age 30+)
-   My research interests are interpersonal deception, antagonistic
    personalities and behaviours, and how people obtain, process, and
    use social information/person perception in their everyday lives
-   Got my PhD in 2014, post-doc with the Intelligence Agencies,
    Teaching Fellow then Lecturer in the department of Psychology
-   And I [LOVE IT !!]{.shout} The Psychology we do here is unique!
:::

## But first

::: incremental
-   The importance of your 'participation'
-   If you don't engage, it is difficult to respond to your needs
-   I want you to find **"MyPsychology"**
-   Easier to keep up than catch-up
-   We have numerous safeguards in place to protect you this year
-   The only thing that should be worried this year is Shoddy Science!

:::

## You aren't spectators any more, you're Scientists!

In small groups of 3 or 4 people, you will:

::: small
::: incremental
-   Identify an area of psychological research
-   Review and critique the literature in this area (Critical Proposal)
-   Develop a testable hypothesis
-   Design a 2x2 ANOVA experiment unique to you (within your group
    study)
-   Obtain Ethical Approval for your experiment
-   Collect REAL data
-   Analyse these data
-   Write up the results in APA format with Open Data and Materials
    (Mini-Diss)
-   Reflect on your learning and development journey (CHIP Learning Log)
:::
:::

## Consider it a 'warm up' for your Y3 Dissertation

::: small
-   The same 20-week timeline
-   The same skills and techniques you will need
-   Careful step-by-step guidance and support in the lab setting
-   Scaled-down experiments and write-ups - but all the same moving
    parts
-   The security of working in a group
-   Tips and advice from world-class researchers
-   Opportunities to think carefully about your final year Dissertation,
    and how to crush it!!
:::

## Support and guidance

::: incremental
-   Gordon (Module Coordinator and [Enthusiast in Chief]{.shout})
-   7 gobsmackingly amazing Lab Tutors
-   Your Mini-Dissertation group (3 or 4)
-   Your Personal Tutor
-   Your PT group
-   The entire Goldsmiths Research Community!
:::

This is a team-sport

## Access to me

I will be in every Research Methods lecture and I have a Student Hour
from 3-4 every Monday, before we all go to the Design & Analysis
lecture. Yup! Me too!

**Available at g.wright\@gold.ac.uk and my office is WB200/1**

I genuinely could not imagine anything I would rather do that this. So
please talk to me!

## A friendly warning

::: callout-warning
## Warning

All coursework is [INDIVIDUAL]{.shout} and subject to normal plagiarism
and collusion rules.

Just don't risk it. Be mindful of how you read, take notes and share
coursework.
:::

## Module structure

1 x 1 hr Lecture per week (Monday 11-12 PSH LG02)

1 x 2 hr Lab per week (Tuesday in Whitehead)

4 x Personal Tutor meetings focussed on the Mini-Diss across the year

## Weekly Structure (Lectures)

A brief weekly '**Prelude**' designed to introduce one of the main
topics of the week (Not compulsory)

**Lecture** covering Methods relevant to your research, concepts and
debates around CHIP, and previewing the lab session that week

-   (recording posted automatically to Panopto)

-   \*Materials for following week posted on Wednesday evening

-   CHIP-relevant topics to be approved as a group (more on that later)

\*Accessibility is important to me, so please contact me with any
concerns or requests

## **Weekly Structure (Labs)**

::: incremental
-   **'Pulse'** taken on entry - 2 minute quiz - COMPULSORY
-   **OneNote Lab Notebook** with brief 'generative activities' and
    opportunities for metacognitive reflection (wk2)
    -   [Your 'Source of Truth']{.underline}
-   Lots can be achieved in the labs, but independent study and
    coordinated group work will be required
-   This module is a ***process*** not a goal - approach it like an
    experiment!
:::

::: incremental
-   [NO EXAM]{.shout}
    -   **Extras** provided around skills or applications or just
        interesting stuff (Not compulsory)
:::

## Coursework

The courseworks ALL require reflection and metacognitive practice. This
will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it contributes to
effective learning and your integration of the skills and experience.

## Time management and teamwork

..will both be required.

I ask you to see both as an **opportunity** to deliberately practice
these important skills.

You will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers
and employability.

It is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.

## Resources

We will be releasing a **series** of valuable resources to help you
through every step of the process

These will **entirely relevant** to your final year dissertation also.

**Contribution to and comment** on these is welcome and hoped for!

**Open Educational Resources** will be used extensively, and most core
readings are available online via the library.

    a continuous Dependent Variable* 
-   Conscientiousness (Low or high - Independent Variable IV1)

:::

## Rest of the group:

[**The effect of Conscientiousness and Caffeine intake on Academic
Self-Handicapping**]{.takeaway} 

::: incremental
1.  [Extraversion]{.underline} (Low/High) & Sleep (Sound/Disturbed) on
    [ASH]{.underline} 
2.  [Openness to experience]{.underline} (Low/High) & Family Attitude to
    Education (Pro/Con) on [ASH]{.underline}

    -   Not too complicated, right?
    -   Can you see the economies of effort and implicit support opps?
:::

## Lab 01

::: incremental
-   Scan your attendance (?) and sit down to complete the short 'Entry
    Pulse' poll (Compulsory each week).
-   Verify access to IT systems (e.g. the critically important OneDrive)
    and add a signature to your emails to assist College answering any
    questions you have.
-   Start brainstorming ideas for research topics for your
    Mini-Dissertation.
-   Consider 'how' you want to work this year - Help co-create a 'Lab
    Ethos' that we can share openly.
-   Detailed information in the Lab 01 'Book' on the VLE
:::

## Please don't get hung up on topic selection

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Tip

You might think coming up with a research topic is a difficult thing.
For this year, it is NOT super-important. Your Lab Tutors will be
available to help you make sure it's feasible, challenging enough but
not too difficult etc.

It does help if you are interested in it though, as it will help keep
motivation up!
:::

## Some things to consider

::: callout-caution
## Caution

-   Picking something without much of a literature behind it can make
    life VERY difficult

-   We will try to make sure things remain manageable, we are not trying
    to 'restrict' you

-   You will not be able to do research

    ::: incremental
    -   on Children
    -   on Vulnerable or protected groups
    -   using methods that require extensive training or specialist
        facilities (e.g. EEG, TMS)
    -   that raises anything more than mild ethical considerations
    -   for which recruitment will be too onerous or time-consuming
    :::
:::

## Defining how you wish to work

We would like you to compose a 'code of conduct' or 'Lab ethos'
applicable to us all this year.

[Goldsmiths Student Charter]{.underline} (2012) Does much change in a
decade?

[BPS Research Ethics]{.underline} (respect, competence, responsibility,
integrity)

[Corporate Culture]{.underline} (e.g. "***Move fast and break things***"
i.e. approaching the task with an emphasis on speed, disruption and
experimentation)

[Innovative Teaching]{.underline} (e.g. The Hacker School/Recurse
Center - No feigning surprise, No 'Well-Actually's, No back-seat
driving, no subtle -isms)

## How will we approach the following?

Inclusivity, Diversity, Equity, Privilege, Power, Intersectionality

Communication, Accommodation, Environment, Accessibility, Collaboration

## Data Carpentry suggests the following for their labs

-   Use welcoming and inclusive language
-   Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism
-   Focus on what is best for the community
-   Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

## Recurse Center 'Social Rules'

![](images/paste-753EB69B.png){fig-align="center"}

## On behalf of the whole teaching team

Have a wonderful year!
