## Critical Proposal

. . .

In the most part, the Critical Proposal showed a very high quality of work

. . .

Clear engagement with the critical evaluative process taught last year.

. . .

A modest progression towards the practicalities and process of real research.

An integral part of the assignment

Worth valuable marks

:::

## Essay 1

Essay 1 is based on the content of ONE of the topics and should adopt at least two of the following 6 'perspectives'.

-   ::: incremental
    -   As a **STUDENT** of psychology

    -   As a **TRAINEE** psychologist

    -   In relation to a **RESEARCH** application in your future

    -   As an **HISTORIAN** of psychology

    -   Reporting on the culture or **PRACTICE** of psychology as it currently exists here or across cultures

    -   As a critic or supporter of psychology's status as a **SCIENCE**
    :::

## Essay 1 tips

-   ::: incremental
    -   Ask a specific question -- and answer it.

    -   Intro, body, conclusion structure.

    -   Reflect on the topic and give your own opinion as to the answer!

    -   Present a journey in your learning or appreciation of the topic

    -   Ensure your answer is argued using examples

    -   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do some strategic wider reading

    -   Present and reference it well
    :::

## Essay 2

Essay 2 should focus on at least one of the OTHER topics covered in the course.

-   ::: incremental
    -   This answer should focus on a primary reading associated with the lectures and then any further reading you have done (strongly encouraged).

    -   You must identify that primary reading explicitly in the essay itself.

    -   You should not simply restate what the authors thought or found, but rather briefly summarise the point that stimulated your interest in the reading and use that as a springboard to discuss the topic or issue.

    -   Think about your perspective on the issues.

    -   What do you think about this debate or issue? We want to know!

    -   And what do you think are interesting directions for psychologists to take this debate or issue in the future?
    :::

## Essay 2 tips

-   ::: incremental
    -   Explicitly identify a single initial reading and build upon that.

    -   Discuss a debate or issue that you think is interesting or important

    -   Give your own opinion and how this has developed or changed as a result of the lecture, the course more widely, and/or the reading.

    -   Argue your opinion explicitly, own it and back it up with examples

    -   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do some strategic wider reading

    -   Present and reference it well
    :::

## Overlapping content

-   ::: incremental
    -   You can combine across different topics in Essay 2 (e.g., you could talk about Evolution and Consciousness, or Inclusivity and Science), and thinking about links between topics is strongly encouraged.

    -   However, the material covered in Essay 2 must be different from Essay 1. Students will be penalised for covering identical topics.
    :::

## Details

-   ::: incremental
    -   Due 10 am 21st April 2023 - about 3 weeks after the end of term

    -   Both answers should be written in essay-style prose (e.g., with APA references where you refer to sources) put in a single document and submitted to the coursework submission page.

    -   Max 700 words per answer (references not included in word count)

    -   Remember that this only accounts for a smaller portion of the module grade (15%). Should hopefully be an enjoyable way to reflect on issues on the course you found interesting.
