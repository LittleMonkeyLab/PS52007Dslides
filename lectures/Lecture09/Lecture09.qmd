# CHIP Learning Log

Designed to introduce you to

Conceptual and Historical Issues in Psychology

Big picture stuff!

The topics of focus this year are:

Science -- 2 lectures from Professor Joydeep Bhattacharya

Inclusivity -- 2 lectures from Dr Tegan Penton

Evolution -- 2 lectures from Professor Alice Gregory

Consciousness -- 2 lectures from Professor Joydeep Bhattacharya

All topics that cut across any individual area of psychology

## Assignment

Coursework piece designed to allow you to engage reflexively with the
'big picture' of your degree

Think about how these issues link into psychology as a discipline, and
how they relate to your own thoughts about what psychology is or should
be

Two essays of max 700 words each

Marks are awarded for reflection, evidence of learning and bring topics
together. Please see marking criteria for both essays.

Not looking for a restatement of the facts in the lectures etc.

They are designed to be personal and reflective -- embrace this aspect!

## Essay 1

Essay 1 is based on the content of ONE of the FOUR topics and should
adopt at least two of the following 6 'perspectives'.

a\.     STU - Your interests or experience as a student of psychology

b\.     TRN - Your role as a trainee psychologist

c\.     RES - A planned research project in or after your degree

d\.     HIS - The history of Psychology and related disciplines;

e\.     BAK - The cultural background to Psychology;

f\.      SCI - Assumptions about science and how it relates to
psychology

## Essay 1 tips

Ask a specific question -- and answer it.

Intro, body, conclusion structure.

Reflect on the topic and give your own opinion as to the answer!

Present a journey in your learning or appreciation of the topic

Ensure your answer is argued using examples

Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do some
strategic wider reading

Present and reference it well

## Essay 2

Essay 2 should focus on at least one of the OTHER topics covered in the
course.

This answer should focus on a primary reading associated with the
lectures and then any further reading you have done (strongly
encouraged).

You must identify that primary reading explicitly in the essay itself.

You should not simply restate what the authors thought or found, but
rather briefly summarise the point that stimulated your interest in the
reading and use that as a springboard to discuss the topic or issue.

Think about your perspective on the issues.

What do you think about this debate or issue? We want to know!

And what do you think are interesting directions for psychologists to
take this debate or issue in the future?

## Essay 2 tips

Explicitly identify a single initial reading and build upon that.

Discuss a debate or issue that you think is interesting or important

Give your own opinion and how this has developed or changed as a result
of the lecture, the course more widely, and/or the reading.

Argue your opinion explicitly, own it and back it up with examples

Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do some
strategic wider reading

Present and reference it well

## Overlapping content

You can combine across different topics in Essay 2 (e.g., you could talk
about Evolution and Consciousness, or Inclusivity and Science), and
thinking about links between topics is strongly encouraged.

However, the material covered in Essay 2 must be different from Essay 1.
Students will be penalised for covering identical topics.

## stuff

Due about weeks after the end of term

Both answers should be written in essay-style prose (e.g., with APA
references where you refer to sources) put in a single document and
submitted to the coursework submission page.

Max 700 words per answer (references not included in word count)

Remember that this only accounts for a smaller portion of the module
grade (15%). Should hopefully be an enjoyable way to reflect on issues
on the course you found interesting.
