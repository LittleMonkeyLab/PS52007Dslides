Ask for any help you need.\n\n## Module Milestones (by end of this week)\n\n-   I'm in my group and we have a plan\n-   I've got a rough idea of the Topic of my Mini-Dissertation\n-   If after today, I sit down and read, or jot down ideas, whether for\n    Essay or MD - it's useful productive work\n",
