(2022). Why science?. In R. Biswas-Diener & E. Diener (Eds),\n*Noba textbook series: Psychology.* Champaign, IL: DEF publishers.\n<http://noba.to/qu4abpzy>\n\n# 2 - Artificial Intelligence - Promise or Peril?\n\n## Last year, this was a fairly philosophical question\n\nThis year, you are probably using AI on a daily or weekly basis. I don't\nneed to give you 1980's movie references to show you how we thought\ncomputers were going to take over the world and enslave the human race,\nwe can just look out the window!\n\n## CHIP topic approval process\n\nLectures identified with `CHIP` in the title e.g. weeks 16-20 \\[They\nchange yearly!\\]\n\nI am open to other topics, but they must fit the following brief, and be\nagreed in the Forum.\n\n::: incremental\n-   A concept or debate within Psychology\n-   A historical issue or controversy\n-   A methodology or approach and its promises or limitations\n-   A distinctive or divisive topic\n-   A modern innovation or applied challenge\n:::\n\n<https://www2.open.ac.uk/openlearn/CHIPs/>\n\n# I can't make bricks without clay!\n\n## A psychologist? A scientist?\n\n![](images/paste-DE336E79.png)\n\nIn this instance, Sherlock is talking about the need for data prior to\nsolving a case. You can't do science without data.\n\n## Scientists base their 'claims' on EVIDENCE\n\n![](images/paste-F158EEA8.png)\n\n## Evidence quality = claim quality!\n\n![](images/paste-BD7BCD67.png)\n\n## It starts with a hypothesis\n\n![](images/paste-D3D307F4.png)\n\n## recap on hypotheses\n\n![](images/paste-0E0430B8.png)\n\n## The research process\n\n![](images/paste-B4426E76.png)\n\n## The simplicity of an experiment\n\n![](images/paste-3D25B713.png)\n\n## Operationalisation\n\n![](images/paste-A9D3934A.png)\n\n## The challenge of operationalisation\n\n![](images/paste-C6316887.png)\n\n## A toy example\n\n![](images/paste-D76E2D76.png)\n\n## Extraneous variables\n\n![](images/paste-4B088F3A.png)\n\n## Usually...\n\n![](images/paste-5770750E.png)\n\n## but occasionally...\n\nyou hear of 'confounds' or ['confounding variables']{.shout}\n\nA confounding variable is an extraneous variable that [systematically\nvaries]{.underline} with one of your independent variables. These are\nrare, but nothing can save the experiment.\n\n![](images/paste-B5DC6F1B.png)\n\n## An impossible interpretation\n\n![](images/paste-755BCA67.png)\n\n## Manipulations almost always introduce potential confounds\n\n![](images/paste-EF9EB1AF.png)\n\n## Experimental skill + careful thought + piloting + randomness!\n\n![](images/paste-1931EC21.png)\n\n## The importance of operationalising your variables well\n\n![](images/paste-9B52240F.png)\n\n## Reading along\n\nI highly recommend reading along with the general topics we cover in the\nfirst few weeks.\n\nResearch Methods in Psychology by Dennis Howitt and Duncan Cramer is\nexcellent. Chapter 2 in that book (right at the top of the module\nreading list and\n[here](https://www.vlebooks.com/Product/Index/896220?page=0)) deals with\nHypotheses and aims of research, essentially what we cover this week,\nand Chapter 1 deals with the basics and golden rules of research design\nand designing good experiments.\n\n# Another interpretation of \"I can't make bricks without clay!\"\n\n## Garbage in, Garbage out\n\nLast year someone selected a 'target paper' for their Critical Proposal\n\\[next week's lecture topic\\] from a Sociology Journal - it presented a\n'thought experiment'.\n\nNo data, no methodology, no participants, no actual experiment.\n\nHow do you think they did?\n\n## The literature you read will drive the quality of your output\n\n-   This applies to the study you design for your Mini-Dissertation\n-   This applies to your Module Essays\n-   This applies to your Critical Proposal\n-   It is NOT a question of QUANTITY\n-   It is very much a question of QUALITY\n-   It is a function of QUALITY and QUANTITY\n\n# Lab 2 is about Literature Search and Management\n\n# Effect Sizes\n\n## A measure of the Effect (MOTE)\n\nEffect sizes represent the magnitude of a relationship between\nvariables, for example between a Manipulation and the Dependent\nVariable.\n\nIt's like the 'strength' of your pill, or intervention, or manipulation.\n\nDo not run an experiment that is designed to fail - you must believe a\nmanipulation will have an 'Effect'\n\nIf the manipulation works, then there will be an Effect\n\nThe Effect Size is just how big that visible effect was.\n\n## Let's imagine the simplest example possible\n\nAn independent t-test. Working Memory Capacity.\n\nI have a magic pill to increase working memory capacity.\n\n7 Â± 2 is the Miller Law. Let's read this as normal mean working memory\ncapacity for a group of humans is mean 7 units with a standard deviation\nof 2 units.\n\nLet's say my pill was tried on a group of humans, and when we measured\ntheir mean working memory capacity it was 11 units with a standard\ndeviation of 2 units. Wowsers!\n\nThat's an effect size of d=2. Simply put, Cohen's d is always presented\nin units equivalent to 1 standard deviation. So 11 is 2 SDs higher than\n7.\n\n[Calculating Effect Sizes\n(shinyapps.io)](https://katherinemwood.shinyapps.io/lakens_effect_sizes/)\n",
