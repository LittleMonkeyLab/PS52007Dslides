Any questions?\n\n![](images/LabSession.drawio-01.png)\n\n## Goals for today/this week\n\nThe immediate goals for this session, and for this week (including your\nindependent study time)\n\n-   Identify potential group members and have this confirmed by the\n    start of Lab 2\n-   Identify potential research topics and methodologies you might use\n-   Clarify any questions that may persist\n-   After today, we move on and start doing work. Any more time spent on\n    these tasks is wasted time.\n-   You should be almost sorted by the end of the session today, at\n    least with a short-list of topics, methods, or potential team-mates,\n    and prepared to use independent study time to finalise your group\n    (for sure) or to continue thinking about topics & methods.\n-   Next week will be Literature search support for this module and the\n    Personality Essay (Double Whammy!) and discussing Effect Sizes and\n    how to calculate and convert them. A requirement for the week 3\n    Essay Submission! (Triple Whammy?)\n\n## The rules of the Mini-Dissertation game\n\n-   Your ultimate individual Mini-Dissertation project MUST conform to\n    the following definitive rules:\n-   2x2 ANOVA design with 2 categorical IVs (each with 2 levels) and a\n    single continuous DV\n-   You must obtain ethical approval and prove individual involvement in\n    the process of application\n-   You must make a sample size estimation / Power calculation\n-   You must individually and collaboratively contribute to group data\n    collection efforts\n-   Your Mini-Dissertation final submission must comprise:\n    -   a 2500 word APA7 empirical paper with a critical reflection and\n        complete reference list\n    -   a single, cleaned, clearly-labelled data set in Excel format (or\n        similar) - Open Data\n    -   a complete, replication-ready materials document detailing\n        materials relevant to your submission - Open Materials\n\n## Critical Proposal\n\nThere is a detailed brief on the Critical Proposal (Due Week 5) on the\nVLE.\n\nIt will be the focus of week 3 in both Lecture and Lab, but requires you\nto identify an empirical paper on your research topic, so more on that\nin due course.\n\n## Activities for today.\n\nThese labs are driven by you. The only things that will EVER be\ncompulsory are short administrative tasks on a roughly fortnightly basis\n(group progress update) and the next activity. Otherwise you can use the\ntime as you see fit either alone or in your group, but we know that\nthere is wisdom in the crowd for coming up with topic ideas, identifying\ncool research ideas and setting the tone for the year ahead.\n\n## Let's get going.\n\n-   Lab Challenge! \\[15 mins\\]\n-   Research Skill Audit\n-   Topic Speed Dating\n-   Methods Matching\n-   Goal Alignment and Group Ethos\n\n## Lab Challenge\n\nTo be introduced by the Lab Tutor. hehe!\n\n## Research Skill Audit\n\nBy assessing your current confidence level, you will be able to think\nstrategically about the 20 weeks ahead.\n\n## Topic Speed Dating\n\nThe worksheet will provide some tips and ideas for finding a topic to\nresearch. Even if you think you've nailed it, let's discuss it.\n\n## Methods Matching\n\nIt is easy to only think about online questionnaires. It may be some of\nthe only research you've done, but frankly, it would be a shame to not\nthink more expansively. Some ideas will be discussed, and a discussion\nabout the Lab Challenge might prompt some ideas.\n\n## Goal Alignment and Group Ethos\n\nAnother aspect of effective Group work is Goal Alignment. Even if you\nare working with your best buddy, they may want to just get in and out,\nwhile you want to immerse yourself in the task ahead.\n\nThis would be a conflict that is potentially dangerous. Think about your\ngoals, your aspirations, and then consider how your might formalise\nthese in to a set of guidelines.\n\nPlease do take the time to do this. Being able to point to a set of\nprinciples (for your group or for the whole lab) may smooth the process\nor be of help in resolving difficulties.\n\n## References\n",
