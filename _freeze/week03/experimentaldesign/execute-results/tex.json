In this review, we'll explore the concepts of Independent\nVariables (IVs), Dependent Variables (DVs), and how experiments are\ndesigned to determine causal links. We'll use golf putting as our\nrunning example.\n\nClarifying Independent and Dependent Variables for Your\nMini-Dissertation:\n\nI want to remind you how crucial it is to fully grasp the concept of\nIndependent Variables (IVs) and Dependent Variables (DVs). These were\ncovered in depth last year and are central to the research design of\nyour mini-dissertation. If you're experiencing challenges now, it may\nstem from not being completely confident or competent in distinguishing\nbetween these key elements.\n\nThe Independent Variable is what you, as the researcher, manipulate or\ncategorize, and the Dependent Variable is what you measure as a result\nof these manipulations. Whether you're working on an experimental or\ncorrelational study, mastering this distinction is critical.\n\nPlease take time to revisit this foundational concept, as a clear\nunderstanding will simplify the complexity of your research and improve\nyour analysis moving forward.\n\n## Independent Variables (IVs)\n\n### Definition\n\nAn Independent Variable is the factor that researchers manipulate or\nchange in an experiment. It's the presumed cause in a cause-effect\nrelationship. I remember this by saying \"the IV is the variable I\nmanipulate!\" - silly, but effective!\n\n### Characteristics\n\n-   Controlled by the researcher\n-   Has two or more levels or conditions\n-   Manipulated to observe its effect on the Dependent Variable\n\n### Golf Putting Example\n\nIn a golf putting experiment, potential Independent Variables could\ninclude: - Hole size (e.g., small vs. big) - Putting distance (e.g., 5\nfeet vs. 10 feet) - Crowd noise (e.g., booing vs. cheering) - Incentive\n(e.g., win a egg, or lose an egg)\n\n## Dependent Variables (DVs)\n\n### Definition\n\nA Dependent Variable is the outcome that is measured in an experiment.\nIt's the presumed effect in a cause-effect relationship. I remember this\nas \"the DV is the **d**ata I collect that **d**epends on the **result**\nof the manipulation\"\n\n### Characteristics\n\n-   Observed and measured by the researcher\n-   Changes in response to the Independent Variable (if a causal\n    relationship exists)\n-   Quantifiable and measurable in the right way!\n\n### Golf Putting Example\n\nIn our golf putting experiment, potential Dependent Variables could\ninclude:\n\n-   Percentage of successful putts\n\n-   Distance from the hole for missed putts\n\n-   Consistency of putting stroke (measured by the purity of the sound\n    when hit)\n\n## Experiments to Determine Causal Links (golf joke!)\n\n### Purpose\n\nExperiments are designed to establish a causal relationship between the\nIV and DV by controlling for other factors that might influence the\noutcome.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1.  Control: Minimizing the influence of extraneous variables\n2.  Randomization: Assigning participants or conditions randomly\n3.  Replication: Repeating the experiment to ensure reliability\n\n### Steps in Experimental Design\n\n1.  Formulate a hypothesis\n2.  Identify and define the IV and DV\n3.  Design the experimental procedure\n4.  Collect and analyze data\n5.  Draw conclusions\n\n# Golf Putting Example (take 1) Between-groups design\n\n## Experiment Overview\n\n-   Independent Variable (IV):\n    -   Presence of crowd noise (2 levels: Booing vs. Cheering)\n-   Dependent Variable (DV):\n    -   Putting accuracy (percentage of successful putts)\n\n## Between-Groups Design Concept\n\nIn this between-groups design:\n\n-   We have two separate groups of participants\n\n-   Each group experiences only one condition of the IV\n\n-   We compare the mean scores of the two groups on the DV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Golf Putting Experiment Example\n\n### Hypotheses\n\n-   Null Hypothesis (H0):\n    -   There is no significant difference in putting accuracy between\n        the booing and cheering conditions.\n-   Alternative Hypothesis (H1):\n    -   There is a significant difference in putting accuracy between\n        the booing and cheering conditions.\n\n### Method\n\n#### Participants\n\n-   40 amateur golfers (20 per group)\n-   Randomly assigned to either the Booing condition or the Cheering\n    condition\n\n#### Materials\n\n-   Standard putters and golf balls\n-   Putting green with a straight 10-foot putt\n-   Audio system for the cheering condition\n\n#### Procedure\n\n1.  Participants are briefed on the task but not told about the specific\n    hypothesis\n2.  Each participant attempts 20 putts\n3.  Booing group: putts while the horrible crowd boos and jeers\n4.  Cheering group: putts while the crowd goes wild with excitement\n\n### Data Structure\n\nOur data might look like this:\n\n| Participant | Condition | Success Rate (%) |\n|-------------|-----------|------------------|\n| 1           | Booing    | 70               |\n| 2           | Booing    | 65               |\n| ...         | ...       | ...              |\n| 20          | Booing    | 75               |\n| 21          | Cheering  | 80               |\n| 22          | Cheering  | 85               |\n| ...         | ...       | ...              |\n| 40          | Cheering  | 78               |\n\n### Analysis\n\nWe would use an independent samples t-test to analyze this data,\ncomparing the means of the two groups.\n\n## Conducting an Independent Samples t-test\n\n### Assumptions\n\n1.  The DV is continuous\n2.  The IV consists of two categorical, independent groups\n3.  There is independence of observations\n4.  No significant outliers in either group\n5.  The DV is approximately normally distributed for each group\n6.  There is homogeneity of variances\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe won't go into this here but it might look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](experimentaldesign_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Interpretation & Reporting\n\n-   If p \\< Î± (typically 0.05), reject the null hypothesis\n\n-   Report the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and effect size\n    (e.g., Cohen's d)\n\n> There was a significant difference in putting success rates between\n> the cheering (M = 79.74%, SD = 4.15) and booing (M = 70.71%, SD =\n> 4.86) conditions; t(37) = -6.32, p \\< 0.001, d = 2.00. The cheering\n> condition resulted in a 9.04 percentage point increase in putting\n> success rate compared to the booing condition.\n\n## Advantages and Limitations\n\n### Advantages\n\n-   Avoids order effects and practice effects\n-   Each participant only needs to be tested once\n-   Suitable for manipulations that cannot be easily reversed, like a\n    nice or awful crowd\n\n### Limitations\n\n-   Requires more participants for the same statistical power as a\n    within-subjects design\n-   Individual differences between groups could affect the results\n    -   For example, one group might coincidentally have more skilled\n        golfers\n-   Each participant provides data for only one condition, potentially\n    limiting the richness of the data\n-   More susceptible to the influence of outliers due to smaller\n    per-condition sample sizes\n-   Cannot account for how individuals might respond differently to\n    various conditions\n-   May be less sensitive to detecting small effects due to\n    between-subject variability\n-   Randomization may not always perfectly balance out all potential\n    confounding variables\n-   If the manipulation is obvious, there might be demand\n    characteristics where participants guess the hypothesis and alter\n    their behavior\n-   In our specific golf example, environmental factors (like slight\n    changes in wind or green conditions) might affect one group more\n    than the other if all tests for one condition are done together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Golf Putting Example (take 2) Within-subjects design\n\n## Experiment Overview\n\n-   Independent Variable (IV):\n    -   Incentive type (2 levels: Win an egg vs. Lose an egg)\n-   Dependent Variable (DV):\n    -   Putting accuracy (percentage of successful putts)\n\n## Within-Subjects Design Concept\n\nIn this within-subjects design:\n\n-   Each participant experiences both conditions of the IV\n\n-   The order of conditions is counterbalanced across participants\n\n-   We compare each participant's performance across the two conditions\n\n## Golf Putting Experiment Example\n\n### Hypotheses\n\n-   Null Hypothesis (H0):\n    -   There is no significant difference in putting accuracy between\n        the \"win an egg\" and \"lose an egg\" conditions.\n-   Alternative Hypothesis (H1):\n    -   There is a significant difference in putting accuracy between\n        the \"win an egg\" and \"lose an egg\" conditions.\n\n### Method\n\n#### Participants\n\n-   20 amateur golfers\n-   Each participant completes both conditions in a counterbalanced\n    order\n\n#### Materials\n\n-   Standard putters and golf balls\n-   Putting green with a straight 10-foot putt\n-   Eggs as incentives\n\n#### Procedure\n\n1.  Participants are briefed on the task but not told about the specific\n    hypothesis\n2.  Each participant attempts 20 putts in each condition\n3.  \"Win an egg\" condition: Participant wins an egg for each successful\n    putt\n4.  \"Lose an egg\" condition: Participant starts with 20 eggs and loses\n    one for each missed putt\n5.  Order of conditions is counterbalanced across participants\n\n### Data Structure\n\nOur data might look like this:\n\n| Participant | Win Egg (%) | Lose Egg (%) |\n|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| 1           | 75          | 70           |\n| 2           | 80          | 75           |\n| ...         | ...         | ...          |\n| 20          | 85          | 80           |\n\n### Analysis\n\nWe would use a paired samples t-test to analyze this data, comparing\neach participant's performance across the two conditions.\n\n## Conducting a Paired Samples t-test\n\n### Assumptions\n\n1.  The DV is continuous\n2.  The IV consists of two related groups (repeated measures)\n3.  No significant outliers in the differences between the two related\n    groups\n4.  The distribution of the differences should be approximately normally\n    distributed\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe won't go into this here but it might look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](experimentaldesign_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Interpretation & Reporting\n\n-   If p \\< Î± (typically 0.05), reject the null hypothesis\n\n-   Report the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and effect size\n    (e.g., Cohen's d)\n\n> There was a significant difference in putting success rates between\n> the 'win an egg' (M = 79.87%, SD = 5.09) and 'lose an egg' (M =\n> 74.76%, SD = 4.70) conditions; t(19) = 3.55, p \\< 0.001, d = 0.79. The\n> 'win an egg' condition resulted in a 5.96 percentage point increase in\n> putting success rate compared to the 'lose an egg' condition.\n\n## Advantages and Limitations\n\n### Advantages\n\n-   Controls for individual differences in golfing ability\n-   Requires fewer participants for the same statistical power\n-   Each participant provides data for both conditions, allowing for\n    richer within-subject comparisons\n-   More sensitive to detecting small effects due to reduced error\n    variance\n\n### Limitations\n\n-   Potential for order effects (partially addressed through\n    counterbalancing)\n-   Practice effects may occur as participants become more familiar with\n    the task\n-   Fatigue effects may influence performance in the second condition\n-   Carryover effects from one condition to another (e.g., strategy\n    developed in first condition applied to second)\n-   Cannot be used for manipulations that have lasting effects (unlike\n    the between-subjects design)\n-   Participants may guess the hypothesis more easily, potentially\n    leading to demand characteristics\n-   Analysis can be more complex, especially if order effects need to be\n    accounted for\n-   In our specific golf example, the psychological impact of winning or\n    losing eggs in the first condition might affect performance in the\n    second condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Bridge: From t-tests to One-Way ANOVA\n\nWhen we move beyond comparing just two groups, we enter the realm of\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA). The simplest form of ANOVA is the one-way\nANOVA, which is used when we have one independent variable (IV) with\nthree or more levels.\n\n## One-Way ANOVA: Three Group Comparison\n\nLet's consider an extension of our TeemuBall experiment where we have\nthree types of crowd reactions:\n\nIndependent Variable (IV): Crowd Reaction (3 levels: Booing, Silence,\nCheering) Dependent Variable (DV): Accuracy (percentage of successful\nthrows)\n\n### Design Concept\n\n-   Three separate groups of participants\n-   Each group experiences one type of crowd reaction\n\n### Method\n\n#### Participants\n\n-   60 participants (20 per group)\n-   Randomly assigned to one of three conditions\n\n#### Procedure\n\n1.  Participants are briefed on the task\n2.  Each participant makes 20 throws in their assigned condition\n\n### Data Structure\n\n| Participant | Crowd Reaction | Accuracy (%) |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1           | Booing         | 70           |\n| 2           | Booing         | 75           |\n| ...         | ...            | ...          |\n| 21          | Silence        | 80           |\n| ...         | ...            | ...          |\n| 41          | Cheering       | 85           |\n| ...         | ...            | ...          |\n\n### Analysis\n\n-   One-way between-groups ANOVA\n\n### Key Points\n\n1.  **Extension of t-test**: One-way ANOVA is an extension of the\n    independent samples t-test, allowing comparison of more than two\n    groups.\n2.  **Overall F-test**: ANOVA provides an overall F-test to determine if\n    there are any significant differences among the groups.\n3.  **Post-hoc tests**: If the overall F-test is significant, post-hoc\n    tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) can determine which specific groups differ\n    from each other.\n4.  **Efficiency**: One-way ANOVA is more efficient than conducting\n    multiple t-tests, reducing the risk of Type I errors.\n\nThis bridge from t-tests to one-way ANOVA sets the stage for\nunderstanding more complex designs like the 2x2 ANOVA, where we\nintroduce a second independent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# TeemuBall: 2x2 ANOVA and Three Flavours of Design\n\n## Overview of 2x2 ANOVA\n\nA 2x2 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a powerful statistical technique\nthat allows us to examine the effects of two independent variables (IVs)\nsimultaneously on a dependent variable (DV). It extends the concept of a\nt-test, which compares means between two groups, to a more complex\ndesign with four groups.\n\n### Components of a 2x2 ANOVA:\n\n1.  **Main Effect of IV1**: The overall effect of the first independent\n    variable, averaged across levels of the second IV.\n2.  **Main Effect of IV2**: The overall effect of the second independent\n    variable, averaged across levels of the first IV.\n3.  **Interaction Effect**: The combined effect of both IVs, which may\n    be different from what we'd expect based on the main effects alone.\n\n## 2x2 ANOVA Visual Representations\n\n### Basic 2x2 Table Structure\n\n| Incentive | Booing | Cheering |\n|-----------|--------|----------|\n| Win       | A      | B        |\n| Lose      | C      | D        |\n\n### Main Effect of Crowd Reaction\n\n| Incentive | Booing                | Cheering           |\n|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Win       | [**A**]{color=\"blue\"} | [*B*]{color=\"red\"} |\n| Lose      | [**C**]{color=\"blue\"} | [*D*]{color=\"red\"} |\n\n-   You'd expect A&C to consistently differ from B&D to show Crowd has a\n    general effect\n\n### Main Effect of Incentive\n\n| Incentive | Booing | Cheering |\n|-----------|--------|----------|\n| Win       | **A**  | **B**    |\n| Lose      | *C*    | *D*      |\n\n-   You'd expect A&B to consistently differ from C&D to show Incentive\n    has a general effect\n\n### Interaction Effect\n\n| Incentive | Booing | Cheering                |\n|-----------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Win       | A      | [**B!**]{color=\"green\"} |\n| Lose      | C      | D                       |\n\nIf Crowd and Incentive both have general effects, where they\n**interact** e.g. B (assuming both positive) something magic might\nhappen there.\n\nIf you have trouble grasping this (common) think about Drug\ninteractions. You shouldn't take Drug 1 and Drug 2 together or your nose\nwill grow. If you are not taking either drug, fine. If you are taking\nonly one of the two drugs, fine. But if you are in the condition where\nyou are taking both drugs... they interact and your nose grows!\n\nThese schematic representations help illustrate:\n\n1.  The basic structure of a 2x2 design\n2.  How main effects involve comparisons across one variable (ignoring\n    the other)\n3.  How interaction effects involve the unique combinations of both\n    variables\n\n### Advantages over Multiple t-tests:\n\n1.  **Efficiency**: Conducts multiple comparisons in a single analysis,\n    reducing the risk of Type I errors.\n2.  **Interaction Detection**: Can identify how the effect of one IV\n    depends on the levels of the other IV.\n3.  **Increased Power**: Generally has more statistical power to detect\n    effects than multiple separate t-tests.\n\n## Experiment Overview\n\nTask:\n\n-   Participants throw balls into Teemu's Topmiler (a hat that looks\n    like a basketball net)\n\nIndependent Variables (IVs):\n\n-   1\\.

When you read a research\narticle you will often see graphs that show the results from designs\nwith multiple factors. It would be good for you if you were comfortable\ninterpreting the meaning of those results. The skill here is to be able\nto look at a graph and see the pattern of main effects and interactions.\nThis skill is important, because the patterns in the data can quickly\nbecome very complicated looking, especially when there are more than two\nindependent variables, with more than two levels.\n\n## 2x2 designs\n\nLet's take the case of 2x2 designs. There will always be the possibility\nof two main effects and one interaction. You will always be able to\ncompare the means for each main effect and interaction. If the\nappropriate means are different then there is a main effect or\ninteraction. Here's the thing, there a bunch of ways all of this can\nturn out. Check out the ways, there are 8 of them:\n\n1.  no IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction\n2.  IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction\n3.  IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction\n4.  IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction\n5.  IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction\n6.  no IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction\n7.  no IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction\n8.  no IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction\n\nOK, so if you run a 2x2, any of these 8 general patterns could occur in\nyour data. That's a lot to keep track of isn't. As you develop your\nskills in examining graphs that plot means, you should be able to look\nat the graph and visually guesstimate if there is, or is not, a main\neffect or interaction. You will need you inferential statistics to tell\nyou for sure, but it is worth knowing how to know see the patterns.\n\n@fig-10bar22 shows the possible patterns of main effects and\ninteractions in bar graph form. Here is a legend for the labels in the\npanels.\n\n-   1 = there was a main effect for IV1.\n-   \\~1 = there was **not** a main effect for IV1\n-   2 = there was a main effect for IV2\n-   \\~2 = there was **not** a main effect of IV2\n-   1x2 = there was an interaction\n-   \\~1x2 = there was **not** an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![8 Example patterns for means for each of the possible kinds of general outcomes in a 2x2 design.](experimentaldesign_files/figure-pdf/fig-10bar22-1.pdf){#fig-10bar22 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-10lines22 shows the same eight patterns in line graph form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Line graphs showing 8 possible general outcomes for a 2x2 design.](experimentaldesign_files/figure-pdf/fig-10lines22-1.pdf){#fig-10lines22 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graphs accentuates the presence of interaction effects.\nWhenever the lines cross, or would cross if they kept going, you have a\npossibility of an interaction. Whenever the lines are parallel, there\ncan't be an interaction. When both of the points on the A side are\nhigher or lower than both of the points on the B side, then you have a\nmain effect for IV1 (A vs B). Whenever the green line is above or below\nthe red line, then you have a main effect for IV2 (1 vs. 2). We know\nthis is complicated. You should see what all the possibilities look like\nwhen we start adding more levels or more IVs. It gets nuts. Because of\nthis nuttiness, it is often good practice to make your research designs\nsimple (as few IVs and levels as possible to test your question). That\nway it will be easier to interpret your data. Whenever you see that\nsomeone ran a 4x3x7x2 design, your head should spin. It's just too\ncomplicated.\n\n## Interpreting main effects and interactions\n\nThe interpretation of main effects and interactions can get tricky.\nConsider the concept of a main effect. This is the idea that a\nparticular IV has a consistent effect. For example, drinking 5 cups of\ncoffee makes you more awake compared to not drinking 5 cups of coffee.\nThe main effect of drinking 5 cups of coffee vs not drinking coffee will\ngenerally be true across the levels of other IVs in our life. For\nexample, let's say you conducted an experiment testing whether the\neffect of drinking 5 cups of coffee vs not, changes depending on whether\nyou are in your house or in a car. Perhaps the situation matters? No,\nprobably not so much. You will probably still be more awake in your\nhouse, or your car, after having 5 cups of coffee, compared to if you\nhadn't.\n\nThe coffee example is a reasonably good example of a consistent main\neffect. Another silly kind of example might be the main effect of shoes\non your height. For example, if your IV was wearing shoes or not, and\nyour DV was height, then we could expect to find a main effect of\nwearing shoes on your measurement of height. When you wear shoes, you\nwill become taller compared to when you don't wear shoes. Wearing shoes\nadds to your total height. In fact, it's hard to imagine how the effect\nof wearing shoes on your total height would ever interact with other\nkinds of variables. You will be always be that extra bit taller wearing\nshoes. Indeed, if there was another manipulation that could cause an\ninteraction that would truly be strange. For example, imagine if the\neffect of being inside a bodega or outside a bodega interacted with the\neffect of wearing shoes on your height. That could mean that shoes make\nyou taller when you are outside a bodega, but when you step inside, your\nshoes make you shorter...but, obviously this is just totally ridiculous.\nThat's correct, it is often ridiculous to expect that one IV will have\nan influence on the effect of another, especially when there is no good\nreason.\n\nThe summary here is that it is convenient to think of main effects as a\nconsistent influence of one manipulation. However, when an interaction\nis observed, this messes up the consistency of the main effect. That is\nthe very definition of an interaction. It means that some main effect is\n**not** behaving consistently across different situations. Indeed,\nwhenever we find an interaction, sometimes we can question whether or\nnot there really is a general consistent effect of some manipulation, or\ninstead whether that effect only happens in specific situations.\n\nFor this reason, you will often see that researchers report their\nfindings this way:\n\n\"We found a main effect of X, BUT, this main effect was qualified by an\ninteraction between X and Y\".\n\nNotice the big **BUT**. Why is it there? The sentence points out that\nbefore they talk about the main effect, they need to first talk about\nthe interaction, which is making the main effect behave inconsistently.\nIn other words, the interpretation of the main effect depends on the\ninteraction, the two things have to be thought of together to make sense\nof them.\n\nHere are two examples to help you make sense of these issues:\n\n### A consistent main effect and an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example means showing a generally consistent main effect along with an interaction](experimentaldesign_files/figure-pdf/fig-10mainint-1.pdf){#fig-10mainint width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-10mainint shows a main effect and interaction. There is a main\neffect of IV2: the level 1 means (red points and line) are both lower\nthan the level 2 means (aqua points and line). There is also an\ninteraction. The size of the difference between the red and aqua points\nin the A condition (left) is bigger than the size of the difference in\nthe B condition.\n\n**How would we interpret this**? We could say there WAS a main effect of\nIV2, BUT it was qualified by an IV1 x IV2 interaction.\n\n**What's the qualification**? The size of the IV2 effect changed as a\nfunction of the levels of IV1. It was big for level A, and small for\nlevel B of IV1.\n\n**What does the qualification mean for the main effect**? Well, first it\nmeans the main effect can be changed by the other IV. That's important\nto know. Does it also mean that the main effect is not a real main\neffect because there was an interaction? Not really, there is a\ngenerally consistent effect of IV2. The green points are above the red\npoints in all cases. Whatever IV2 is doing, it seems to work in at least\na couple situations, even if the other IV also causes some change to the\ninfluence.\n\n### An inconsistent main effect and an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example data showing how an interaction exists, and a main effect does not, even though the means for the main effect may show a difference](experimentaldesign_files/figure-pdf/fig-10mainintInc-1.pdf){#fig-10mainintInc width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-10mainintInc shows another 2x2 design. You should see an\ninteraction here straight away. The difference between the aqua and red\npoints in condition A (left two dots) is huge, and there is 0 difference\nbetween them in condition B. Is there an interaction? Yes!\n\nAre there any main effects here? With data like this, sometimes an ANOVA\nwill suggest that you do have significant main effects. For example,\nwhat is the mean difference between level 1 and 2 of IV2? That is the\naverage of the green points ( (10+5)/2 = 15/2= 7.5 ) compared to the\naverage of the red points (5). There will be a difference of 2.5 for the\nmain effect (7.5 vs. 5).\n\nStarting to see the issue here? From the perspective of the main effect\n(which collapses over everything and ignores the interaction), there is\nan overall effect of 2.5. In other words, level 2 adds 2.5 in general\ncompared to level 1. However, we can see from the graph that IV2 does\nnot do anything in general. It does not add 2.5s everywhere. It adds 5\nin condition A, and nothing in condition B. It only does one thing in\none condition.\n\nWhat is happening here is that a \"main effect\" is produced by the\nprocess of averaging over a clear interaction.\n\n**How would we interpret this**? We might have to say there was a main\neffect of IV2, BUT we would definitely say it was qualified by an IV1 x\nIV2 interaction.\n\n**What's the qualification**? The size of the IV2 effect completely\nchanges as a function of the levels of IV1. It was big for level A, and\nnonexistent for level B of IV1.\n\n**What does the qualification mean for the main effect**? In this case,\nwe might doubt whether there is a main effect of IV2 at all. It could\nturn out that IV2 does not have a general influence over the DV all of\nthe time, it may only do something in very specific circumstances, in\ncombination with the presence of other factors.\n\n## Mixed Designs\n\nThroughout this book we keep reminding you that research designs can\ntake different forms. The manipulations can be between-subjects\n(different subjects in each group), or within-subjects (everybody\ncontributes data in all conditions). If you have more than one\nmanipulation, you can have a mixed design when one of your IVs is\nbetween-subjects and one of the other ones is within-subjects.\n",
