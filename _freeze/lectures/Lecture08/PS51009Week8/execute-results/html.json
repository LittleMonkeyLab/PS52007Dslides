Think of our cheeky little monkey. What did HE want?\n\n-   Access to food\n-   Access to shelter\n-   Access to mates\n-   Safety and Security of self and offspring\n\nNavigating the hierarchy successfully requires cooperation and\ncompetition.\n\nThe Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis\n\nThe Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis posits that social demands\nhave driven the evolution of the cognitive facilities humans employ to\nnavigate their social domain.\n\n'Machiavellian' strategies, such as deception, interpersonal\nmanipulation, cooperation, and alliance formation allow individuals to\nachieve higher social and reproductive success.\n\nMaybe it would help to be a bit more \"Machiavellian\"?\n\n## How could we measure 'Lie Frequency'?\n\n![](images/paste-5E12FEC5.png)\n\nSelf-report\n\nDiary study (or similar)\n\nSome kind of app?\n\nExperimental research\n\n## Deception in the wild\n\n![](images/paste-ABF42C39.png)\n\n![](images/paste-6B93028F.png)\n\n## Machiavellianism\n\nSensitive to social context, and will switch quickly between cooperation\nand competition depending on utility\n\nEndorse emotional manipulation and use emotional skills to ingratiate\n\nComprises a cynical view of human nature and interpersonal manipulation\ntactics (perception of the world and behaviour)\n\n## Narcissism\n\nVain, 'grandiose sense of self', with high levels of entitlement\n\nThe Narcissist is unique and special\n\nNarcissists, as a result of being surrounded by 'mere mortals' may show\nreduced empathy for others and disregard their goals or status\n\nNarcissists maintain their grandiose sense of self by seeking out\npraise, adoration, adulation and avoiding realistic feedback\n\nGrandiose/Vulnerable types have been suggested.\n\n## Psychopathy\n\nManifest disregard for other people - Low empathy, disruptive behaviours\nverging on bullying or sadism, deception thought to be a central\nfeature.\n\nSuperficial charm and glibness. Erratic lifestyle factors and high\nimpulsivity. Extreme reward appetite and low fear of loss or punishment.\nOften related to criminal activity.\n\nBoldness, Meanness, Disinhibition is the 3 Factor structure suggested by\nthe Triarchic Model (Patrick 2010, onwards)\n\n## Bonus prize - Sadism\n\nAs part of the Dark Tetrad, sadism is investigated in its subclinical\nmanifestation---***everyday sadism***.\n\nWhen people enjoy watching violent movies or even playing violent games\nas a social escape to manifest their sadistic traits it is referred to\nas ***vicarious sadism***.\n\nThere is sometimes an alternative aspect called ***direct sadism***, but\nit is actually far too rare to be useful in most studies.\n\nIn turn, higher scores in everyday sadism are associated with injuring\nothers verbally, physically, and/or psychologically, inspired by a\nhedonic value of being cruel.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](images/paste-119912CF.png)\n\nSome Quality References\n\nDeception and the Dark Triad\n\n@turi2022a\n\n## References\n",
