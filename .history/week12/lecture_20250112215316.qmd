## Introduction

::: incremental
-   I want to briefly talk about some methods we haven't covered yet.
-   And to a certain extent, the topic doesn't matter, soooo..
-   I'm going to tell you about a few of my own studies for a change.
-   Key objective: Show how different methods can bring different insights.
-   AND: To give you some ideas for next year

## Mixing Methods

### Quantitative Research has been our primary focus until this term

You've started hearing about Qualitative Methods with Hilary

## So how do you explore such a broad range of contexts/motives?

One simple approach is to blend methods based on the requirements of the study.

## A rare opportunity to combine methods! Thanks BBC!

## In case I missed any methods, here is the full list

-   Behavioural Indices (akin to polygraph - GSR/EDA, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Accelerometry)
-   Language - Linguistic Inquiry & Word Count - Language Style Matching
-   Paraverbal behaviour - non-speech utterances, turn-taking, chronometrics
-   Non-Verbal Behaviour - Posture, Facial Expressions, Eye behaviour, self-touching etc
-   Full body motion Capture (XSens - 17 accelerometers across the body)

# Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis

## Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)

-   **Definition**: IPA is a qualitative research approach that focuses on exploring how individuals make sense of events. Focused on understanding individuals' subjective experiences and perspectives regarding specific situations.

    -   The core of this approach lies in comprehending how people perceive and ***make sense*** of events, rather than examining the external events themselves. It demands '***double hermeneutics***'

-   **Methodology**:

    -   Involves detailed, reflective examinations of participants' lived experiences.
    -   Typically uses small, purposively selected samples to provide in-depth insights.
    -   Data is usually collected through semi-structured interviews or personal diaries.

## Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) 2

-   **Analysis**:
    -   Emphasizes the interpretative role of the researcher (*hermeneutics*) in making sense of participants' experiences (*double hermeneutics*).
    -   Involves a cyclical process of reading and re-reading data, coding, and theme development.
    -   Seeks to uncover the meaning and significance of experiences from the participant's perspective.
-   **Application**:
    -   Particularly useful in psychology for understanding complex, emotionally laden, and deeply personal experiences.
    -   Aims to provide a detailed, nuanced
-   **Case Study** - Quarterlife Crisis.

## Ethnography - The study of Groups 1

-   **Definition**: Ethnography is the in-depth study of a group and its culture over an extended period. Derived from Greek 'ethnos' (nation or group) and 'graph' (writing), it's a key method in cultural anthropology and other social sciences.

-   **Focus**:

    -   Everyday behaviors, interactions, language, and rituals of a group.
    -   Cultural norms, beliefs, practices, social structures, and patterns.
    -   Both explicit (observable) and implicit (subconscious) cultural elements.

-   **Applications**:

    -   Originally used in anthropology, now applied in education, social sciences, marketing + Psych.
    -   Studies diverse cultures, from traditional societies to modern online communities.

## Ethnography - The study of Groups 2

-   **Fieldwork Essentials**:
    -   Prolonged engagement in the group's natural setting for authentic observation.
    -   Gaining access through gatekeepers, establishing rapport, and ensuring informed consent.
    -   Balancing roles from an outside observer to an immersed participant, maintaining objectivity.
-   **Data Collection**:
    -   Participant observation, interviews, extensive field notes, and collection of artifacts.
    -   Critical ethnographies focus on marginalized groups, seeking transformative insights.

## Ethnography - The study of Groups 3

-   **Note**:
    -   Ethnography requires a balance between involvement and objectivity.
    -   Ideal for researchers interested in the complexities of sociocultural dynamics.
-   **Can be adapted**:
    -   e.g. Video-Reflective Ethnography

## Diary Studies in Qualitative Research 1

-   **Overview**:
    -   Diary studies involve participants keeping regular records of their daily lives, experiences, thoughts, and feelings.
    -   These records provide real-time, first-person accounts, offering rich, contextual insights.
-   **Methodology**:
    -   Participants are asked to record entries over a set period, which can range from days to months.
    -   Diaries can be structured with specific prompts or unstructured, allowing free expression.
-   **Applications in Psychology**:
    -   Useful for studying patterns in behavior, mood, social interactions, and psychological states.
    -   Provides a longitudinal perspective, capturing changes and developments over time.

## Diary Studies in Qualitative Research 2

-   **Advantages**:
    -   Captures data in participants' natural environments, leading to high ecological validity.
    -   Offers a deeper understanding of subjective experiences and daily life contexts.
    -   Enables the study of phenomena as they occur, reducing recall bias.
-   **Challenges**:
    -   Relies on participant commitment and honesty in regular entries.
    -   Data can be voluminous and varied, requiring careful and sensitive analysis.
    -   Potential issues with privacy and ensuring confidentiality of personal records.
-   **Tips**:
    -   Engage the participant with the study's purpose and diary guidelines to participants.
    -   Attrition is HUGE.
    -   Be prepared for a detailed and nuanced analysis of the diary entries (qual AND quant).
    -   Consider alternatives such as **Experience Sampling**, or **Day Reconstruction** @silvia2021
