It extends the concept of a t-test, which compares means between two groups, to a more complex design with four groups.\n\nComponents of a 2x2 ANOVA:\n\nMain Effect of IV1: The overall effect of the first independent variable, averaged across levels of the second IV.\nMain Effect of IV2: The overall effect of the second independent variable, averaged across levels of the first IV.\nInteraction Effect: The combined effect of both IVs, which may be different from what we’d expect based on the main effects alone."

When you read a research article you will often see graphs that show the results from designs with multiple factors. It would be good for you if you were comfortable interpreting the meaning of those results. The skill here is to be able to look at a graph and see the pattern of main effects and interactions. This skill is important, because the patterns in the data can quickly become very complicated looking, especially when there are more than two independent variables, with more than two levels."

    "text": "2x2 designs\nLet’s take the case of 2x2 designs. There will always be the possibility of two main effects and one interaction. You will always be able to compare the means for each main effect and interaction. If the appropriate means are different then there is a main effect or interaction. Here’s the thing, there a bunch of ways all of this can turn out. Check out the ways, there are 8 of them:\n\nno IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction\nIV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction\nIV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction\nIV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction\nIV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction\nno IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction\nno IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction\nno IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction\n\nOK, so if you run a 2x2, any of these 8 general patterns could occur in your data. That’s a lot to keep track of isn’t. As you develop your skills in examining graphs that plot means, you should be able to look at the graph and visually guesstimate if there is, or is not, a main effect or interaction. You will need you inferential statistics to tell you for sure, but it is worth knowing how to know see the patterns.\nFigure 1 shows the possible patterns of main effects and interactions in bar graph form. Here is a legend for the labels in the panels.\n\n1 = there was a main effect for IV1.\n~1 = there was not a main effect for IV1\n2 = there was a main effect for IV2\n~2 = there was not a main effect of IV2\n1x2 = there was an interaction\n~1x2 = there was not an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: 8 Example patterns for means for each of the possible kinds of general outcomes in a 2x2 design.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the same eight patterns in line graph form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Line graphs showing 8 possible general outcomes for a 2x2 design.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graphs accentuates the presence of interaction effects. Whenever the lines cross, or would cross if they kept going, you have a possibility of an interaction. Whenever the lines are parallel, there can’t be an interaction. When both of the points on the A side are higher or lower than both of the points on the B side, then you have a main effect for IV1 (A vs B). Whenever the green line is above or below the red line, then you have a main effect for IV2 (1 vs. 2). We know this is complicated. You should see what all the possibilities look like when we start adding more levels or more IVs. It gets nuts. Because of this nuttiness, it is often good practice to make your research designs simple (as few IVs and levels as possible to test your question). That way it will be easier to interpret your data. Whenever you see that someone ran a 4x3x7x2 design, your head should spin. It’s just too complicated."

    "title": "Experimental Design",
    "section": "Interpreting main effects and interactions",
    "text": "Interpreting main effects and interactions\nThe interpretation of main effects and interactions can get tricky. Consider the concept of a main effect. This is the idea that a particular IV has a consistent effect. For example, drinking 5 cups of coffee makes you more awake compared to not drinking 5 cups of coffee. The main effect of drinking 5 cups of coffee vs not drinking coffee will generally be true across the levels of other IVs in our life. For example, let’s say you conducted an experiment testing whether the effect of drinking 5 cups of coffee vs not, changes depending on whether you are in your house or in a car. Perhaps the situation matters? No, probably not so much. You will probably still be more awake in your house, or your car, after having 5 cups of coffee, compared to if you hadn’t.\nThe coffee example is a reasonably good example of a consistent main effect. Another silly kind of example might be the main effect of shoes on your height. For example, if your IV was wearing shoes or not, and your DV was height, then we could expect to find a main effect of wearing shoes on your measurement of height. When you wear shoes, you will become taller compared to when you don’t wear shoes. Wearing shoes adds to your total height. In fact, it’s hard to imagine how the effect of wearing shoes on your total height would ever interact with other kinds of variables. You will be always be that extra bit taller wearing shoes. Indeed, if there was another manipulation that could cause an interaction that would truly be strange. For example, imagine if the effect of being inside a bodega or outside a bodega interacted with the effect of wearing shoes on your height. That could mean that shoes make you taller when you are outside a bodega, but when you step inside, your shoes make you shorter…but, obviously this is just totally ridiculous. That’s correct, it is often ridiculous to expect that one IV will have an influence on the effect of another, especially when there is no good reason.\nThe summary here is that it is convenient to think of main effects as a consistent influence of one manipulation. However, when an interaction is observed, this messes up the consistency of the main effect. That is the very definition of an interaction. It means that some main effect is not behaving consistently across different situations. Indeed, whenever we find an interaction, sometimes we can question whether or not there really is a general consistent effect of some manipulation, or instead whether that effect only happens in specific situations.\nFor this reason, you will often see that researchers report their findings this way:\n“We found a main effect of X, BUT, this main effect was qualified by an interaction between X and Y”.\nNotice the big BUT. Why is it there? The sentence points out that before they talk about the main effect, they need to first talk about the interaction, which is making the main effect behave inconsistently. In other words, the interpretation of the main effect depends on the interaction, the two things have to be thought of together to make sense of them.\nHere are two examples to help you make sense of these issues:\n\nA consistent main effect and an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example means showing a generally consistent main effect along with an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows a main effect and interaction. There is a main effect of IV2: the level 1 means (red points and line) are both lower than the level 2 means (aqua points and line). There is also an interaction. The size of the difference between the red and aqua points in the A condition (left) is bigger than the size of the difference in the B condition.\nHow would we interpret this? We could say there WAS a main effect of IV2, BUT it was qualified by an IV1 x IV2 interaction.\nWhat’s the qualification? The size of the IV2 effect changed as a function of the levels of IV1. It was big for level A, and small for level B of IV1.\nWhat does the qualification mean for the main effect? Well, first it means the main effect can be changed by the other IV. That’s important to know. Does it also mean that the main effect is not a real main effect because there was an interaction? Not really, there is a generally consistent effect of IV2. The green points are above the red points in all cases. Whatever IV2 is doing, it seems to work in at least a couple situations, even if the other IV also causes some change to the influence.\n\n\nAn inconsistent main effect and an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Example data showing how an interaction exists, and a main effect does not, even though the means for the main effect may show a difference\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows another 2x2 design. You should see an interaction here straight away. The difference between the aqua and red points in condition A (left two dots) is huge, and there is 0 difference between them in condition B. Is there an interaction? Yes!\nAre there any main effects here? With data like this, sometimes an ANOVA will suggest that you do have significant main effects. For example, what is the mean difference between level 1 and 2 of IV2? That is the average of the green points ( (10+5)/2 = 15/2= 7.5 ) compared to the average of the red points (5). There will be a difference of 2.5 for the main effect (7.5 vs. 5).\nStarting to see the issue here? From the perspective of the main effect (which collapses over everything and ignores the interaction), there is an overall effect of 2.5. In other words, level 2 adds 2.5 in general compared to level 1. However, we can see from the graph that IV2 does not do anything in general. It does not add 2.5s everywhere. It adds 5 in condition A, and nothing in condition B. It only does one thing in one condition.\nWhat is happening here is that a “main effect” is produced by the process of averaging over a clear interaction.\nHow would we interpret this? We might have to say there was a main effect of IV2, BUT we would definitely say it was qualified by an IV1 x IV2 interaction.\nWhat’s the qualification? The size of the IV2 effect completely changes as a function of the levels of IV1. It was big for level A, and nonexistent for level B of IV1.\nWhat does the qualification mean for the main effect? In this case, we might doubt whether there is a main effect of IV2 at all. It could turn out that IV2 does not have a general influence over the DV all of the time, it may only do something in very specific circumstances, in combination with the presence of other factors."
