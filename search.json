It demands ‘double hermeneutics’\n\nMethodology:\n\nInvolves detailed, reflective examinations of participants’ lived experiences.\nTypically uses small, purposively selected samples to provide in-depth insights.\nData is usually collected through semi-structured interviews or personal diaries."

Derived from Greek ‘ethnos’ (nation or group) and ‘graph’ (writing), it’s a key method in cultural anthropology and other social sciences.\nFocus:\n\nEveryday behaviors, interactions, language, and rituals of a group.\nCultural norms, beliefs, practices, social structures, and patterns.\nBoth explicit (observable) and implicit (subconscious) cultural elements.\n\nApplications:\n\nOriginally used in anthropology, now applied in education, social sciences, marketing + Psych.\nStudies diverse cultures, from traditional societies to modern online communities."
